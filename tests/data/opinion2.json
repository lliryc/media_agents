See NMSA 1978, § 62-16-4(D) (2019) (providing\n\n 7   for the award of “financial or other incentives”); Renewable Energy Act, NMSA\n\n 8   1978, §§ 62-16-1 to -10 (2004, as amended through 2021) (the REA or the Act)1.\n\n 9   We then consider SPS’s numerous facial challenges to the PRC’s April 2021 order.\n\n10   That order adopted 2021 amendments to Rule 572 (the Amended Rule)⸺regulations\n\n11   implementing the PRC’s duties under the REA’s 2019 amendments, including the\n\n\n\n\n           1\n             The REA’s 2019 amendment is relevant to this opinion. The current (2021)\n     REA consists of two statutes from 2007, seven from 2019, and one⸺ Section 62-\n     16-5⸻enacted in 2019 and amended in 2021 by the addition of Subsection (B)(1)(d)\n     (on which this opinion does not rely). Accordingly in this opinion, all nondated\n     references to the REA or to the Act and all citations of statutes therein are supported\n     fully by the current enactments.\n\f 1   duty to award an incentive when appropriate.2 See Renewable Energy for Electric\n\n 2   Utilities, 17.9.572 NMAC (5/4/2021, as amended through 2/28/2023); 17.9.572.22\n\n 3   NMAC (5/4/2021) (setting forth requirements to apply for an incentive).\n\n 4   {2}   We hold that SPS’s proposed retirement of banked, renewable energy\n\n 5   certificates (RECs) to exceed the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) was\n\n 6   insufficient to qualify for an incentive under the REA because the proposed\n\n 7   retirement would not have “produce[d] or acquire[d] renewable energy” as required\n\n 8   by Section 62-16-4(D). 3 See § 62-16-3(G) (“‘[REC]’ means a certificate or other\n\n 9   record . . . that represents all the environmental attributes from one megawatt-hour\n\n10   of electricity generated from renewable energy.”); § 62-16-3(I) (“‘[RPS]’ means the\n\n11   minimum percentage of retail sales of electricity by a public utility . . . that is\n\n12   required by the [REA] to be from renewable energy . . . .”). Our conclusion is based\n\n\n\n           2\n             SPS has filed two additional appeals that separately challenge the PRC’s\n     subsequent orders denying SPS’s application for a financial incentive for 2023 and\n     approving further amendments to Rule 572 in February 2023 (the Second Amended\n     Rule). See S-1-SC-39733; S-1-SC-39796; see also 17.9.572 NMAC (2/28/2023).\n     We have consolidated and held in abeyance those appeals pending the outcome of\n     this proceeding.\n           3\n             We use the phrase “banked REC” throughout this opinion to refer to an REC\n     that represents renewable energy generated in a year before the year in which the\n     REC is retired. See § 62-16-5(B)(4) (providing that an REC “may be carried forward\n     for up to four years from the date of issuance to establish compliance with the [RPS],\n     after which [the REC] shall be deemed retired”).\n\n                                               2\n\f 1   on the statute’s plain language, which is consistent with the REA’s clear legislative\n\n 2   intent to require public utilities to procure sufficient renewable energy resources to\n\n 3   reduce carbon emissions and achieve the zero carbon resource standard by 2045. See\n\n 4   § 62-16-4(A) (providing public utilities with a sequence of increasingly renewable,\n\n5    energy benchmarks to achieve by 2045); § 62-16-3(K) (“‘[Z]ero carbon resource’\n\n6    means an electricity generation resource that emits no carbon dioxide into the\n\n 7   atmosphere . . . as a result of electricity production.”).\n\n 8   {3}   We also hold that the challenged provisions of the Amended Rule (1) do not\n\n 9   exceed the scope of the REA; (2) are not arbitrary, capricious, or void for vagueness;\n\n10   and (3) are not otherwise unreasonable or unlawful. We therefore affirm the PRC in\n\n11   all respects. See NMSA 1978, § 62-11-5 (1982) (“The supreme court shall vacate\n\n12   and annul the order complained of if it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the\n\n13   court that the order is unreasonable or unlawful.”).\n\n14   I.    BACKGROUND\n\n15   {4}   SPS’s primary objection is to the PRC’s approach to awarding incentives\n\n16   under the REA and the Amended Rule and the resulting denial of SPS’s incentive\n\n17   application. We therefore begin with an overview of the REA and its incentive\n\n18   provision and the PRC’s 2021 amendments to Rule 572, before summarizing SPS’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f 1   incentive request and the PRC’s reasons for denial. We then address SPS’s\n\n 2   arguments in turn.\n\n 3   A.    Overview of the REA and the 2021 Amendments to Rule 572\n\n 4   {5}   Section 62-16-4 is the heart of the REA. Among other things, the provision\n\n 5   establishes the RPS and the related requirements for public utilities to meet that\n\n 6   standard. See id.; see also § 62-16-3(I). Before 2019, Section 62-16-4 set forth a\n\n 7   series of increasing RPS benchmarks culminating in a requirement for public utilities\n\n 8   to supply at least twenty percent of retail electricity sales from renewable energy by\n\n 9   2020. See § 62-16-4(A)(1)(a)-(d) (2014); see also § 62-16-3(F) (“‘[R]enewable\n\n10   energy’ means electric energy generated by use of renewable energy resources and\n\n11   delivered to a public utility.”). In 2019, the Legislature extended the sequence of\n\n12   RPS benchmarks intended to achieve the ambitious zero carbon resource standard\n\n13   by 2045. See § 62-16-4(A)(1)-(6); see also § 62-16-3(L) (“‘[Z]ero carbon resource\n\n14   standard’ means providing New Mexico public utility customers with electricity\n\n15   generated from one hundred percent zero carbon resources.”). At present, renewable\n\n16   energy must make up at least twenty percent of a utility’s retail sales, which will\n\n17   increase to a minimum of forty percent by 2025, fifty percent by 2030, and eighty\n\n18   percent by 2040. See § 62-16-4(A)(2)-(5). In addition to these intermediate\n\n19   benchmarks, the Legislature mandated that “[r]easonable and consistent progress\n\n\n                                               4\n\f1    shall be made over time toward [the] requirement” of supplying one hundred percent\n\n2    of retail electricity sales in New Mexico from zero carbon resources by 2045. Section\n\n3    62-16-4(A)(6).\n\n 4   {6}   Section 62-16-4 also prescribes the manner in which a public utility must\n\n 5   comply with the RPS. To comply, a utility must retire enough RECs annually to\n\n 6   “meet the [RPS] requirements” relative to the utility’s total retail sales of electricity.\n\n 7   See § 62-16-4(A); see also § 62-16-5(A)(1) (providing that the PRC shall establish\n\n 8   “a system of [RECs] that can be used by a public utility to establish compliance with\n\n 9   the [RPS]”). One REC represents one megawatt-hour of electricity generated from\n\n10   renewable energy and “may be carried forward for up to four years from the date of\n\n11   issuance to establish compliance with the [RPS], after which [the REC] shall be\n\n12   deemed retired.” Section 62-16-5(B)(4); see § 62-16-3(G). Thus, any excess RECs\n\n13   that are not retired in the same year they are earned may be banked for up to four\n\n14   years and used to meet a utility’s annual RPS obligation during that period. In\n\n15   addition, excess RECs “may be traded, sold or otherwise transferred by their owner,\n\n16   unless the certificates are from a rate-based public utility plant, in which case the\n\n17   entirety of the [RECs] from that plant shall be retired by the utility on behalf of itself\n\n18   or its customers.” Section 62-16-5(B)(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f 1   {7}   Of particular importance to this appeal, Section 62-16-4 also provides for the\n\n 2   award of “financial or other incentives” for exceeding the Act’s minimum\n\n 3   requirements. See § 62-16-4(D). Before 2019, the REA tasked the PRC with\n\n 4   “provid[ing] appropriate performance-based financial or other incentives to\n\n 5   encourage public utilities to acquire renewable energy supplies that exceed the\n\n 6   applicable annual [RPS].” Section 62-16-4(A)(4) (2007); see also § 62-16-2(A)(5)\n\n 7   (2007) (“The legislature finds that . . . a public utility should have incentives to go\n\n 8   beyond the minimum requirements of the [RPS] . . . .”). The 2019 amendments to\n\n 9   Section 62-16-4 elaborated on the bases for which an incentive may be awarded:\n\n10         [T]he commission shall . . . develop and provide financial or other\n11         incentives to encourage public utilities to produce or acquire renewable\n12         energy that exceeds the applicable annual [RPS] set forth in this section;\n13         results in reductions in carbon dioxide emissions earlier than required\n14         by Subsection A of this section; or causes a reduction in the generation\n15         of electricity by coal-fired generating facilities, including coal-fired\n16         generating facilities located outside of New Mexico.\n\n17   Section 62-16-4(D). Where the pre-2019 Act allowed incentives “to encourage\n\n18   public utilities to acquire renewable energy supplies that exceed the applicable\n\n19   annual [RPS],” § 62-16-4(A)(4) (2007), the Act now allows incentives “to encourage\n\n20   public utilities to produce or acquire renewable energy” that exceeds the RPS, results\n\n21   in early reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, or reduces coal-fired generation, §\n\n22   62-16-4(D).\n\n\n                                               6\n\f 1   {8}   In response to the 2019 amendments to the REA, the PRC developed and\n\n 2   approved significant amendments to Rule 572, including by adding provisions that\n\n 3   govern the availability of incentives. See 17.9.572.22 NMAC (5/4/2021).4 Among\n\n 4   other things, the Amended Rule restates the general requirements set forth in Section\n\n 5   62-16-4(D) and articulates other, more specific requirements that a proposed course\n\n 6   of action must satisfy to qualify for an incentive. For example, an incentive is\n\n 7   available, by definition, “to encourage certain behaviors or actions that would not\n\n 8   otherwise have occurred in order to further the outcomes described in Section 62-\n\n 9   16-4 . . . .” See 17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (5/4/2021) (emphasis added).5 Similarly, an\n\n10   incentive “must be related to measures implemented by the utility after the effective\n\n11   date of this rule.” 17.9.572.22(B) NMAC (5/4/2021) (emphasis added). 6 And an\n\n12   incentive will not be awarded “with respect to a particular investment if the cost of\n\n\n\n\n           4\n            Previous versions of Rule 572 did not address the incentive provisions of the\n     Act. See generally 17.9.572 NMAC (5/31/2013); 17.9.572 NMAC (8/30/2007).\n           5\n            The 2023 amendments to Rule 572 do not affect this provision. See\n     17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (2/28/2023).\n           6\n              The Second Amended Rule amended this language as follows: “A financial\n     or other incentive proposed under [this section] shall be to encourage the public\n     utility to produce or to acquire renewable energy to accomplish, in the future, at least\n     one of the following purposes: . . . .” 17.9.572.22(B) NMAC (2/28/2023) (emphasis\n     added); see also 17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (5/4/2021) (“The financial incentive . . .\n     motivates certain behaviors or actions.”).\n\n                                                7\n\f 1   that investment exceeds the demonstrable value of the corresponding reduction in\n\n 2   carbon dioxide or other emissions.” 17.9.572.22(D) NMAC (5/4/2021). 7 The\n\n 3   Amended Rule also provides that an “interested person” may apply for an exemption\n\n 4   or variance from any of the rule’s requirements when inter alia a “proposed\n\n 5   alternative is in the public interest.” 17.9.572.21(G) NMAC (5/24/2021). 8 As these\n\n 6   provisions exemplify, the Amended Rule clarifies the circumstances in which an\n\n 7   incentive may be awarded under the REA. Whether that clarity is consistent with the\n\n 8   REA itself is one of the principal questions in this appeal.\n\n 9   B.    Procedural Background\n\n10   {9}   The PRC approved the Amended Rule in an April 2021 order, after an\n\n11   eighteen-month rulemaking aimed at implementing the 2019 amendments to the\n\n12   REA. SPS participated throughout the rulemaking process along with Public Service\n\n13   Company of New Mexico (PNM), El Paso Electric Company (EPE), PRC Utility\n\n14   Division Staff, and various nonutility entities and individuals. SPS timely appealed\n\n15   from the order adopting the Amended Rule, alleging numerous legal infirmities and\n\n16   asking the Court to vacate and annul the order.\n\n\n           The Second Amended Rule renumbered this provision and made minor\n           7\n\n     changes that do not affect its substance. See 17.9.572.22(E) NMAC (2/28/2023).\n           8\n             The Second Amended Rule made minor changes to this provision that do not\n     affect its substance. See 17.9.572.21(A), (B)(7) NMAC (2/28/2023).\n\n                                               8\n\f 1   {10}   Weeks later, SPS filed an application with the PRC under the REA and the\n\n 2   Amended Rule, seeking approvals of its 2022 Annual Renewable Energy Act Plan\n\n 3   and of several proposed rate riders for the same year. These matters were\n\n 4   uncontested and eventually approved by the PRC.\n\n 5   {11}   In the same application, SPS requested a financial incentive for which it\n\n 6   proposed to exceed its twenty percent RPS obligation and meet the forty percent\n\n 7   standard three years before it becomes mandatory as of 2025. Specifically, SPS\n\n 8   proposed to retire enough RECs in 2022, 2023, and 2024 to meet 2025’s forty\n\n 9   percent standard in each of those years. In return, SPS requested a rate rider that\n\n10   would allow it to charge customers one dollar for each REC that it would retire over\n\n11   the twenty percent standard. If approved, SPS projected that it would collect from\n\n12   ratepayers the additional amounts of $1.65 million in 2022; $1.74 million in 2023;\n\n13   and $1.84 million in 2024, for a three-year total incentive of approximately $5.23\n\n14   million. SPS represented that it would not retire “excess RECs early without an\n\n15   incentive to do so.” SPS also maintained that retiring excess RECs to meet the 2025\n\n16   standard “will necessitate that SPS procure more renewable energy resources earlier\n\n17   than would otherwise be needed in order to comply with the REA’s [RPS].”\n\n18   {12}   As a final part of the application, SPS requested a variance from the Amended\n\n19   Rule’s requirement to demonstrate that the cost of retiring extra RECs would not\n\n\n                                              9\n\f 1   exceed “the demonstrable value of the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or\n\n 2   other emissions.” 17.9.572.22(D) NMAC (5/4/2021). Conceding that the proposal\n\n 3   failed to meet that requirement, SPS argued that the requirement “is inconsistent\n\n 4   with the REA” and therefore requested a variance.\n\n 5   {13}   PRC Staff and three of the intervenors in the application proceeding9\n\n 6   “vigorously contested” SPS’s incentive proposal and variance request, both of which\n\n 7   the PRC later denied in an order filed in December 2021. The PRC was careful to\n\n 8   explain in the order that—although the request failed several provisions of the\n\n 9   Amended Rule—the denial was not based on the rule’s requirements. Rather, SPS\n\n10   failed to meet the threshold statutory requirement to qualify for an incentive: SPS\n\n11   “did not propose to ‘produce or acquire’ any renewable energy.” Section 62-16-\n\n12   4(D). The PRC found that SPS introduced “no evidence of any firm plans to acquire\n\n13   or produce any additional renewable energy.” Instead, “SPS only proposed to retire\n\n14   banked excess RECs earlier than it otherwise would [have].” That proposal was\n\n15   insufficient because, in the PRC’s view, “the retirement of RECs is a paper exercise\n\n16   or method by which RPS compliance is demonstrated” and not a proposal to produce\n\n\n            9\n             The three intervenors that opposed the incentive and variance were the New\n     Mexico Large Customer Group, Occidental Permian Ltd. (Occidental), and\n     Louisiana Energy Services. Having intervened in this appeal, these same parties filed\n     a joint answer brief in support of the PRC’s orders challenged by SPS.\n\n                                              10\n\f 1   or acquire renewable energy that exceeds the RPS “as required to be eligible for an\n\n 2   incentive under the statute.”\n\n 3   {14}   In addition to finding failure under Section 62-16-4(D), the PRC separately\n\n 4   concluded that SPS’s incentive application failed to satisfy the provisions of the\n\n 5   Amended Rule summarized above. Specifically, the PRC concluded that SPS’s\n\n 6   proposal did not merit an incentive because the RECs in question “are associated\n\n 7   with . . . existing renewable energy facilities, all of which [1] pre-date Rule 572.22\n\n 8   (contrary to Rule 572.22.B) and [2] were acquired for reasons other than those\n\n 9   contemplated in . . . Section 62-16-4(D) or Rule 572.22.” See 17.9.572.22(B)\n\n10   NMAC (5/4/2021) (providing that an incentive “must be related to measures\n\n11   implemented by the utility after the effective date of this rule” (emphasis added));\n\n12   17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (5/4/2021) (defining “financial incentive” as “money or\n\n13   additional earnings . . . to encourage certain behaviors or actions that would not\n\n14   otherwise have occurred in order to further the outcomes described in Section 62-\n\n15   16-4” (emphasis added)). The request also failed the Amended Rule’s requirement\n\n16   that the costs associated with retiring RECs must not exceed “the demonstrable value\n\n17   of the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions.”\n\n18   17.9.572.22(D) NMAC (5/4/2021). And as for SPS’s requested variance from the\n\n19   latter requirement, the PRC denied the variance as moot because the incentive\n\n\n                                              11\n\f 1   request “failed on many other grounds.” As previously noted however, these\n\n 2   conclusions were ancillary to the PRC’s determination that SPS’s incentive request\n\n 3   failed to produce or acquire renewable energy, as required by Section 62-16-4(D).\n\n 4   {15}   SPS timely appealed from the order denying its incentive request, and we\n\n 5   granted its subsequent motion to consolidate the appeal with its pending appeal\n\n 6   challenging the Amended Rule. We now proceed to the merits of both appeals.\n\n 7   II.    DISCUSSION\n\n 8   {16}   SPS’s core objection to both the Amended Rule and the denial of its incentive\n\n 9   request is the PRC’s interpretation of Section 62-16-4(D) to preclude the award of\n\n10   an incentive for exceeding the RPS by retiring RECs earlier than required by the\n\n11   Act. Because our resolution of this issue effectively disposes of SPS’s appeal by\n\n12   denial of its incentive application, we address it first. We then address SPS’s many\n\n13   remaining arguments against the Amended Rule. 10 As the party challenging the\n\n14   PRC’s orders, SPS has the burden of establishing that the orders are unreasonable or\n\n\n            10\n              The presentation of the issues in this appeal provides a case study as to why\n     the limitations the Legislature has placed on our review encourage trivial argument.\n     See § 62-11-5 (“The supreme court shall have no power to modify the action or order\n     appealed from, but shall either affirm or annul and vacate the same.”). We caution\n     parties that the better approach to advocacy is advancing only credible and\n     discernible claims of error. Tossing in the kitchen sink with the hope of vacating an\n     entire administrative ruling is an ill-conceived strategy that is wasteful of judicial\n     resources.\n\n                                              12\n\f 1   unlawful.

Comm’n, 2019-NMSC-012, ¶ 12, 444 P.3d 460 (observing that the\n\n 3   party challenging the PRC’s order has the burden of showing that the order was\n\n 4   “arbitrary and capricious, not supported by substantial evidence, outside the scope\n\n 5   of the agency’s authority, or otherwise inconsistent with law.” (internal quotation\n\n 6   marks and citation omitted)).\n\n 7   A.     The PRC’s Denial of SPS’s Incentive Application Under Section 62-16-\n 8          4(D) Was Not Unreasonable or Unlawful\n\n 9   {17}   SPS challenges the denial of its incentive application under Section 62-16-\n\n10   4(D) on three grounds. First, SPS argues that the PRC’s interpretation of the statute\n\n11   “ignores the purpose and language of the REA and is consequently arbitrary and\n\n12   capricious, contrary to law, and an abuse of discretion.” In particular, SPS argues\n\n13   that conditioning the award of an incentive on a proposal that would “produce or\n\n14   acquire renewable energy,” § 62-16-4(D), “would lead to absurd results and thwart\n\n15   the Legislature’s intent to incentivize utilities to exceed the RPS.” Second, SPS\n\n16   argues that the availability of incentives under the REA since at least 2007 supports\n\n17   SPS’s proposed reading of the statute. Third, SPS argues that the PRC lacked\n\n18   sufficient evidence to support the hearing examiner’s finding of “speculative” that\n\n19   SPS’s early retirement of extra RECs would result in acquiring additional renewable\n\n20   energy resources earlier than otherwise necessary. We address each argument in\n\n                                              13\n\f 1   turn, and because our resolution of these issues is sufficient to affirm, we decline to\n\n 2   address SPS’s additional arguments related to the denial of its incentive application.\n\n 3   1.     The plain language of Section 62-16-4(D) conditions the award of an\n 4          incentive on a proposal “to produce or acquire renewable energy”\n\n 5   {18}   Whether the PRC erred by construing Section 62-16-4(D) to limit the award\n\n 6   of incentives to proposals that would “produce or acquire renewable energy”\n\n 7   presents a question of statutory interpretation, “which we review de novo.” N.M.\n\n 8   Indus.

Nevertheless, we are\n\n14   “not bound by the agency’s interpretation and may substitute [our] own independent\n\n15   judgment for that of the agency because it is the function of the courts to interpret\n\n16   the law.” Morningstar Water Users Ass’n v.

We must give effect to the statute as written “without room for\n\n 3   construction unless the language is doubtful, ambiguous, or . . . would lead to\n\n 4   injustice, absurdity or contradiction, in which case the statute is to be construed\n\n 5   according to its obvious spirit or reason.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation\n\n 6   omitted).\n\n 7   {20}   SPS does not argue that the PRC’s interpretation of Section 62-16-4(D) is\n\n 8   contrary to the statute’s plain language—nor could it reasonably do so. The language\n\n 9   and structure of the statute support the PRC’s conclusion that Section 62-16-4(D) is\n\n10   “unequivocally clear” that an incentive must encourage a public utility, first and\n\n11   foremost, to “produce or acquire renewable energy.” The statute is similarly clear\n\n12   on exceeding the RPS, the focus of SPS’s argument, as a secondary objective that\n\n13   must be accomplished by the threshold requirement of producing or acquiring\n\n14   renewable energy. Under the statute’s plain language, an incentive will be provided\n\n15   to encourage a public utility “to produce or acquire renewable energy that exceeds\n\n16   the applicable annual [RPS]” or that accomplishes one of the other secondary\n\n17   objectives listed in the statute. See § 62-16-4(D) (providing an incentive “to produce\n\n18   or acquire renewable energy” that reduces carbon emissions earlier than required or\n\n19   that reduces the coal-fired generation of electricity).\n\n\n                                               15\n\f 1   {21}   Instead of offering an alternative construction of Section 62-16-4(D), SPS\n\n 2   argues that a literal interpretation “would lead to absurd results and thwart the\n\n 3   Legislature’s intent to incentivize utilities to exceed the RPS.” SPS points to two\n\n 4   other provisions to illustrate the purported absurdity that would result from a literal\n\n 5   reading of Section 62-16-4(D): (1) the Legislature’s finding that “a public utility\n\n 6   should have incentives to go beyond the minimum requirements of the [RPS],” § 62-\n\n 7   16-2(A)(5); and (2) the mandate that “[a] public utility shall meet the [RPS] . . . as\n\n 8   demonstrated by its retirement of [RECs],” § 62-16-4(A). Based on these provisions,\n\n 9   SPS insists that retiring RECs must be worthy of an incentive to exceed the RPS\n\n10   because retiring RECs is the only way to “establish compliance with the [RPS].”\n\n11   Section 62-16-5(A)(1); see also § 62-16-4(A). The SPS maintains that otherwise,\n\n12   “the Legislature chose to incentivize utilities to exceed the RPS but then failed to\n\n13   provide any mechanism for them to do so.”\n\n14   {22}   We will depart from a statute’s literal meaning when the statute is shown to\n\n15   be ambiguous by “one or more provisions giving rise to genuine uncertainty as to\n\n16   what the legislature was trying to accomplish.” State ex rel. Helman v. Gallegos,\n\n17   1994-NMSC-023, ¶ 23, 117 N.M. 346, 871 P.2d 1352. We see no “genuine\n\n18   uncertainty” about the purpose or meaning of Section 62-16-4(D) in relation to the\n\n19   statute’s plain language. To the contrary, providing an incentive to encourage a\n\n\n                                               16\n\f 1   public utility “to produce or acquire renewable energy” is entirely consistent with\n\n 2   the overarching purpose of Section 62-16-4, particularly after the 2019 amendments\n\n 3   to the REA.\n\n 4   {23}   As previously explained, Section 62-16-4(A) was amended in 2019 to\n\n 5   mandate that public utilities keep pace with a series of increasing RPS benchmarks\n\n 6   and make “[r]easonable and consistent progress” toward supplying one hundred\n\n 7   percent of all retail sales of electricity in New Mexico from zero carbon resources\n\n 8   by the year 2045. Section 62-16-4(A)(6). These demanding requirements signal a\n\n 9   clear legislative intent to reduce and eliminate from the electricity provided to New\n\n10   Mexico public utility customers the use of any electricity generation resources that\n\n11   emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Section 62-16-3(K) (defining a “zero\n\n12   carbon resource,” in part, as “an electricity generation resource that emits no carbon\n\n13   dioxide into the atmosphere” (emphasis added)). As a necessary corollary, these\n\n14   requirements also signal an intent to compel public utilities to procure sufficient zero\n\n15   carbon resources to meet the zero carbon resource standard by 2045. Against this\n\n16   backdrop, an incentive clearly acts as a carrot “to encourage” a public utility to\n\n17   increase its renewable energy portfolio and reduce carbon dioxide and other harmful\n\n18   emissions faster than the REA requires. See § 62-16-4(D). Conditioning an incentive\n\n19   on a proposal that will produce or acquire renewable energy ensures that a proposed\n\n\n                                               17\n\f 1   measure will not qualify for an incentive unless, at minimum, it advances a utility’s\n\n 2   progress toward achieving the zero carbon resource standard. Id. In short, the\n\n 3   statute’s purpose supports and does not undermine its literal meaning.\n\n 4   {24}   To read Section 62-16-4(D) as SPS suggests would elevate form over\n\n 5   substance. The act of retiring RECs alone does nothing to further the statute’s\n\n 6   objectives. SPS’s proposal for an incentive illustrates the point. SPS characterized\n\n 7   its proposal as a plan “to supply no less than 40% of [its] New Mexico retail energy\n\n 8   sales [from renewable energy] three years early.” But SPS’s supporting\n\n 9   documentation showed that in 2020, it actually generated and purchased renewable\n\n10   energy in an amount that was substantially equivalent to its RPS obligation—twenty\n\n11   percent of its retail electricity sales.11 Section 62-16-4(A)(2) (setting forth an RPS\n\n12   of twenty percent, effective January 1, 2020). SPS also admitted that it was not\n\n13   proposing to produce or acquire additional renewable energy or renewable energy\n\n14   resources. Rather, SPS proposed only to retire banked RECs from its sizeable\n\n15   balance of RECs carried forward from renewable energy generated in previous\n\n\n\n             SPS generated and purchased approximately 1.46 million MWh of\n            11\n\n     renewable energy in 2020, which exceeded its RPS compliance requirement by\n     approximately 4,910 MWh or 0.34%. Notably, at SPS’s proposed incentive rate of\n     $1 per MWh, its excess renewable energy for 2020 would have supported an\n     incentive of $4,911, far less than the $1.65 million incentive that it requested for\n     2022.\n\n                                              18\n\f 1   years. 12 SPS’s proposal thus would have done nothing to expand SPS’s renewable\n\n 2   energy portfolio or reduce carbon emissions during the three years that its requested\n\n 3   incentive would have been in effect. We see nothing in the REA to suggest that the\n\n 4   Legislature intended the award of an incentive under these circumstances. We\n\n 5   therefore find no ambiguity that would lead us to ignore the plain meaning of Section\n\n 6   62-16-4(D), and we affirm the PRC’s interpretation of the statute according to its\n\n 7   plain language.\n\n 8   2.     The availability of incentives under the REA since at least 2007 does not\n 9          require the award of an incentive in this case\n\n10   {25}   We are similarly unpersuaded by SPS’s argument that the availability of\n\n11   incentives under the REA since 2007 compels a different result. SPS offered\n\n12   testimony in support of its incentive application that “almost all renewable\n\n13   procurements on SPS’s system were constructed before 2019 with the knowledge\n\n14   that SPS could be eligible for an incentive under the Act.” This testimony reveals a\n\n15   basic misunderstanding of what the Legislature intended an incentive to accomplish.\n\n\n\n            12\n              SPS has represented throughout this proceeding that, unless it receives an\n     incentive to retire its banked RECs early, it has enough banked RECs to allow it to\n     continue meeting its RPS obligations without procuring new renewable resources\n     “until at least 2030.” And even if it receives an incentive to retire RECs early, SPS\n     estimates that it will remain compliant with its existing resources until some time\n     between 2026 and 2029.\n\n                                              19\n\f 1   {26}   Although the REA does not define the term incentive, common definitions\n\n 2   describe it as something that “incites,” “induces,” “motivates,” or “encourages” one\n\n 3   to take action. See, e.g., Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2020),\n\n 4   (defining “incentive” as “something that incites or has a tendency to incite to . . .\n\n 5   action”); New Oxford American Dictionary (3d ed. 2010) (defining “incentive” as\n\n 6   “a thing that motivates or encourages one to do something”); American Heritage\n\n 7   Dictionary (5th ed. 2011) (defining “incentive” as “[s]omething, such as the fear of\n\n 8   punishment or the expectation of reward, that induces action or motivates effort”).\n\n 9   These definitions align closely with the plain language of Section 62-16-4(D), which\n\n10   provides that the PRC shall award an incentive “to encourage public utilities to\n\n11   produce or acquire renewable energy.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n12   {27}   Given that one cannot encourage past behavior, the problem for SPS is simply\n\n13   a matter of timing. We agree that incentives have been available since at least 2007,\n\n14   and had SPS requested an incentive before it constructed the “renewable\n\n15   procurements” in question, it may well have qualified for an incentive to\n\n16   “encourage” the associated investments. Section 62-16-4(D); see also § 62-16-\n\n17   4(A)(4) (2007) (providing for an incentive to “encourage public utilities to acquire\n\n18   renewable energy supplies that exceed the applicable annual [RPS]”). But at this\n\n19   stage, SPS seeks a reward—not an incentive—for renewable resources or energy\n\n\n                                              20\n\f 1   that it already has produced or acquired beyond the REA’s demands. Section 62-16-\n\n 2   4(D) does not authorize the PRC to reward SPS’s past behavior. Having failed to\n\n 3   request an incentive before exceeding its obligations under the REA, SPS’s actions\n\n 4   vis-à-vis Section 62-16-4(D) were voluntary. Those actions do not support\n\n 5   additional compensation from SPS’s customers beyond the reasonable rate of return\n\n 6   that SPS already has earned through the ratemaking process for the electricity\n\n 7   associated with SPS’s banked RECs.\n\n 8   3.     Substantial evidence supports the PRC’s finding that SPS did not\n 9          propose to produce or acquire renewable energy to support its incentive\n10          request\n\n11   {28}   As a final point in our review of the denial of SPS’s incentive application, we\n\n12   address SPS’s argument that the PRC lacked substantial evidence to support the\n\n13   following finding:\n\n14          [T]he Commission concurs with the [Recommended Decision’s]\n15          finding that it was speculative that SPS’s early retirement of excess\n16          RECs would result in the early acquisition of resources to meet SPS’s\n17          RPS in the future because there was no evidence of any firm plans to\n18          acquire or produce any additional renewable energy and because future\n19          acquisitions or procurements would only meet its RPS for compliance\n20          purposes, not exceed its RPS for the purposes required by the financial\n21          incentive statute.\n\n22   SPS argues that the finding is unsupported because “SPS presented uncontroverted\n\n23   testimony that the proposed retirement of RECs to exceed the RPS in 2022 through\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f 1   2024 would accelerate SPS’s need to acquire additional resources by approximately\n\n 2   two to four years.”\n\n 3   {29}   “[W]e will affirm the Commission’s order if it is supported by substantial\n\n 4   evidence, which is evidence that is credible in light of the whole record and that is\n\n 5   sufficient for a reasonable mind to accept as adequate to support the conclusion\n\n 6   reached by the agency.” Citizens for Fair Rates & the Env’t v. N.M. Pub. Regul.\n\n 7   Comm’n, 2022-NMSC-010, ¶ 13, 503 P.3d 1138 (internal quotation marks and\n\n 8   citation omitted)). We address SPS’s substantial-evidence challenge only to the\n\n 9   extent that it may implicate our conclusion that the PRC properly denied SPS’s\n\n10   incentive application under Section 62-16-4(D) because SPS “did not propose to\n\n11   ‘produce or acquire’ any renewable energy.” Our concern therefore is whether the\n\n12   PRC had substantial evidence to find that “there was no evidence of any firm plans\n\n13   to acquire or produce any additional renewable energy.”\n\n14   {30}   As we have previously noted, SPS admitted at the hearing on its application\n\n15   that its incentive proposal did not include a “specific plan” to produce or acquire any\n\n16   additional renewable energy or renewable energy resources. The “uncontroverted\n\n17   testimony” cited by SPS does not suggest otherwise. It merely explains that, based\n\n18   on SPS’s projections,\n\n19          if SPS continues to retire the minimal amount of RECs required to\n20          comply with the RPS, SPS is projecting compliance through 2030 to\n\n                                               22\n\f 1          beyond 2031 . . . . However, if SPS’s plan to meet the 40% requirement\n 2          three years early is approved, SPS is projecting compliance through\n 3          2026 and 2029. In other words, if SPS’s plan is approved, SPS would\n 4          be required to accelerate the acquisition of additional renewable\n 5          resources to maintain RPS compliance.\n\n 6   This testimony underscores the PRC’s finding that SPS did not actually propose to\n\n 7   produce or acquire renewable energy, let alone renewable energy that would exceed\n\n 8   the RPS as required for an incentive under Section 62-16-4(D); rather, SPS merely\n\n 9   offered projections about when it would need to acquire “additional renewable\n\n10   resources to maintain RPS compliance” after expiration of SPS’s incentive at the\n\n11   end of 2024. Based on our review, we hold that substantial evidence supports the\n\n12   PRC’s finding that SPS did not propose to produce or acquire renewable energy to\n\n13   support its request for an incentive.\n\n14   {31}   In sum, with no proposal to produce or acquire renewable energy that exceeds\n\n15   the RPS, the PRC’s denial of SPS’s incentive application under Section 62-16-4(D)\n\n16   was neither unreasonable nor unlawful. Because we affirm the denial under the\n\n17   statute, we need not reach SPS’s arguments that the PRC improperly denied the\n\n18   application under the various provisions of Rule 572.\n\n19   B.     The Amended Rule Is Not Unreasonable or Unlawful\n\n20   {32}   We turn now to SPS’s many challenges to the Amended Rule itself. SPS\n\n21   argues that various provisions of the Amended Rule exceed the scope of the REA,\n\n\n                                             23\n\f 1   are arbitrary and capricious and void for vagueness, and suffer from a litany of other\n\n 2   legal and procedural deficiencies. After the completion of briefing the PRC filed a\n\n 3   motion to dismiss as moot four of the issues raised by SPS in its appeal from the\n\n 4   order approving the Amended Rule. The PRC argued that its subsequent order filed\n\n 5   on December 7, 2022, which approved the Second Amended Rule after the instant\n\n6    appeals were filed, revised certain language in the Amended Rule that SPS had\n\n7    challenged in this appeal. We agree that three of SPS’s arguments are moot, and we\n\n8    address those issues at the end of our analysis. But first, we consider SPS’s\n\n9    arguments that are properly before us.\n\n10   {33}   SPS brings a facial challenge to the rule and therefore must establish that the\n\n11   rule is invalid in all of its applications, not merely “under some specific set of\n\n12   circumstances.” Gila Res. Info. Project v. N.M. Water Quality Control Comm’n,\n\n13   2018-NMSC-025, ¶ 6, 417 P.3d 369 (“Petitioners must establish that no set of\n\n14   circumstances exist where the . . . [r]ule could be valid.”); see also Bounds v. State\n\n15   ex rel. D’Antonio, 2013-NMSC-037, ¶ 14, 306 P.3d 457 (“In a facial challenge to a\n\n16   statute, we consider only the text of the statute itself, not its application.” (brackets,\n\n17   internal quotation marks, and citation omitted)). We emphasize the point because\n\n18   many of SPS’s arguments suffer from the lack of a factual record or any suggestion\n\n19   of an actual injury resulting from the application of the Amended Rule. See Bounds,\n\n\n                                                24\n\f 1   2013-NMSC-037, ¶ 13 (“[Where the petitioner] was unable to show any actual\n\n 2   injury, . . . [he] was unable to pursue an as-applied challenge in which specific facts\n\n 3   would be relevant and was left with only a facial challenge.”).\n\n 4   1.     The Amended Rule’s cost-benefit requirement does not exceed the scope\n 5          of the REA and is not otherwise unreasonable or unlawful\n\n 6   {34}   SPS first challenges the cost-benefit requirement set forth in the Amended\n\n 7   Rule, specifically Rule 572.22(D), which precludes the award of an incentive for a\n\n 8   “particular investment if the cost of that investment exceeds the demonstrable value\n\n 9   of the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions.” SPS argues\n\n10   that the provision (1) ignores the scope of REA-authorized incentives by limiting\n\n11   incentives to investments that result in a reduction in carbon dioxide or other\n\n12   emissions when Section 62-16-4(D) also allows incentives for measures that exceed\n\n13   the RPS or reduce the coal-fired generation of electricity; (2) exceeds the scope of\n\n14   the REA by requiring a cost-benefit analysis that is not required under the REA; (3)\n\n15   is void for vagueness and arbitrary and capricious; and (4) was adopted without\n\n16   notice and comment in violation of due process.\n\n17   a.     Rule 572.22(D) does not preclude an incentive for measures that would\n18          exceed the RPS or reduce coal-fired electricity-generation\n\n19   {35}   SPS argues that Rule 572.22(D) limits incentives “only to investments that\n\n20   result in a reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions” and effectively writes out\n\n\n                                               25\n\f 1   of existence the other two bases under Section 62-16-4(D) for earning an incentive,\n\n 2   namely, exceeding the RPS and reducing the coal-fired generation of electricity.13\n\n 3   This argument is overstated and does not withstand scrutiny.\n\n 4   {36}   Despite SPS’s repeated assertions to the contrary, Rule 572.22(D) does not\n\n 5   necessarily preclude an incentive for measures that would exceed the RPS or reduce\n\n 6   coal-fired generation. Like Section 62-16-4(D), Rule 572.22 expressly provides that\n\n 7   a utility may seek an incentive for implementing measures “to accomplish at least\n\n 8   one of the following purposes: (1) exceeding the public utility’s annual RPS\n\n 9   requirements; (2) reducing carbon dioxide emissions earlier than required by [the\n\n10   RPS]; or (3) reducing the generation of electricity by coal-fired generating\n\n11   facilities.” See 17.9.572.22(A), (B) NMAC (5/4/2021) (emphasis added). The cost-\n\n12   benefit requirement ensures that an investment proposed to accomplish any of these\n\n13   purposes—including exceeding the RPS or reducing the coal-fired generation of\n\n14   electricity—is cost-effective relative to “the demonstrable value of the\n\n15   corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions.” 17.9.572.22(D)\n\n16   NMAC (5/4/2021). That the metric for measuring cost-effectiveness overlaps with\n\n17   the purpose of reducing carbon emissions does not exclude an incentive for\n\n\n\n             The PRC argues that this issue is moot for largely semantic reasons, which\n            13\n\n     we decline to address because we are unpersuaded by SPS’s argument.\n\n                                             26\n\f 1   exceeding the RPS or reducing the coal-fired generation of electricity. Nor does the\n\n 2   metric guarantee an incentive for reducing carbon emissions alone. The cost-benefit\n\n 3   requirement applies equally to any of the purposes for earning an incentive.\n\n 4   {37}   As a fallback to its categorical argument, SPS argues that the cost-benefit\n\n 5   requirement “renders meaningless the provisions of the Rule that purport to allow\n\n 6   incentives for exceeding the RPS or reducing coal-fired generation.” (Emphasis\n\n 7   added.) To illustrate the point, SPS provides the single example of biomass\n\n 8   resources, which the Legislature included in the definition of a renewable energy\n\n 9   resource that can be used to meet and exceed the RPS. See § 62-16-3(H)(3)\n\n10   (providing that biomass resources under the REA are “limited to agriculture or\n\n11   animal waste, small diameter timber, not to exceed eight inches, salt cedar and other\n\n12   phreatophyte or woody vegetation removed from river basins or watersheds in New\n\n13   Mexico”). SPS argues that Rule 572.22(D) precludes a utility from using biomass\n\n14   resources to earn an incentive for exceeding the RPS because “biomass fuel results\n\n15   in substantial carbon emissions and the increased use of biomass fuel to generate\n\n16   electricity would likely not result in a decrease in carbon emissions.”\n\n17   {38}   This argument fails for at least two reasons. First, SPS’s assertions about the\n\n18   “likely” carbon-related effects of biomass resources are not supported by the record\n\n19   and thus are merely the arguments of counsel and not evidence. See, e.g., State v.\n\n\n                                              27\n\f 1   Hall, 2013-NMSC-001, ¶ 28, 294 P.3d 1235 (“It is not our practice to rely on\n\n 2   assertions of counsel unaccompanied by support in the record.” (internal quotation\n\n 3   marks and citation omitted)). Second, SPS’s assertions are contradicted by the REA\n\n 4   itself, which has provided since 2019 that REC-eligible biomass resources must\n\n 5   come from a facility certified to “have zero life cycle carbon emissions.” Section 62-\n\n 6   16-3(H)(3)(b). This lone example therefore does not establish that Rule 572.22(D)’s\n\n 7   cost-benefit requirement precludes an incentive for exceeding the RPS, even when\n\n 8   using biomass resources to do so. To the contrary, any measure that otherwise\n\n 9   qualifies for an incentive can satisfy Rule 572.22(D)—as long as the cost would be\n\n10   less than the value of the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other\n\n11   emissions. 14 We thus disagree that Rule 572.22(D) exceeds the scope of the REA by\n\n12   limiting incentives only to investments that would result in a reduction of carbon\n\n13   dioxide or other emissions.\n\n\n\n           14\n              We also note that, although this is a facial challenge, SPS’s evidence to\n     support its own incentive request similarly failed to show that Rule 572.22(D)\n     precludes the award of an incentive for SPS’s proposal for an incentive. Although\n     SPS admitted that the cost of retiring extra RECs would be greater than the value of\n     the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions, it also volunteered\n     that it had declined to use a different methodology that “could have generated a\n     better result for the cost-benefit analysis required by the rule.” Thus, SPS’s own\n     evidence was inconclusive about whether Rule 572.22(D) “renders meaningless the\n     provisions of the REA that allow incentives for exceeding the RPS.”\n\n                                              28\n\f 1   b.     Rule 572.22(D) is a reasonable exercise of the PRC’s overarching duties\n 2          under the Public Utility Act\n\n 3   {39}   SPS next argues that Rule 572.22(D) exceeds the scope of the REA by\n\n 4   requiring a cost-benefit analysis that is not explicitly required by statute. SPS argues\n\n 5   that, because the REA expressly includes a cost-benefit analysis for measures taken\n\n 6   to meet the 2040 and 2045 RPS levels of eighty percent and one hundred percent,\n\n 7   the exclusion of such an analysis for complying with earlier RPS requirements was\n\n 8   purposeful, such that Rule 572.22(D) is contrary to legislative intent. See § 62-16-\n\n 9   4(B)(3) (“In administering the [eighty percent and one hundred percent RPS\n\n10   standards], the commission shall . . . prevent unreasonable impacts to customer\n\n11   electricity bills, taking into consideration the economic and environmental costs and\n\n12   benefits of renewable energy resources and zero carbon resources . . . .”).\n\n13   {40}   We are not persuaded. This argument fails to consider Rule 572.22(D) in the\n\n14   context of both the REA and the PRC’s broader regulatory duties. Cf. Baker v.\n\n15   Hedstrom, 2013-NMSC-043, ¶ 15, 309 P.3d 1047 (“We must examine [the\n\n16   plaintiffs’] interpretation in the context of the statute as a whole, including the\n\n17   purposes and consequences of the . . . Act.”). The PRC adopted Rule 572.22\n\n18   pursuant to its statutory duty to “promulgate rules to implement the provisions of the\n\n19   [REA],” § 62-16-9, including “to develop and provide financial or other incentives\n\n20   to encourage public utilities to” carry out the purposes of the REA, § 62-16-4(D).\n\n                                               29\n\f 1   See also § 62-16-7(A)(1) (providing that the PRC “shall adopt rules regarding the\n\n 2   [RPS]”). However, the REA provides minimal guidance for determining whether a\n\n 3   requested incentive may be justified, leaving the PRC to apply its broad policy-\n\n 4   making authority and expertise to fill in the legislative gaps to effectuate the\n\n 5   purposes of the REA. See, e.g., New Energy Econ., Inc. v. N.M. Pub Reg. Comm’n,\n\n 6   2018-NMSC-024, ¶ 25, 416 P.3d 277 (“[I]f it is clear that our Legislature delegated\n\n 7   to the PRC (either explicitly or implicitly) the task of giving meaning to interpretive\n\n 8   gaps in a statute, we will defer to the PRC’s construction of the statute as the PRC\n\n 9   has been delegated policy-making authority and possesses the expertise necessary to\n\n10   make sound policy.”). Under these circumstances, the PRC necessarily falls back on\n\n11   its overarching duty to regulate public utilities in a manner that balances the interests\n\n12   of the public, consumers, and investors to ensure “that reasonable and proper\n\n13   services shall be available at fair, just and reasonable rates.” NMSA 1978, § 62-3-1\n\n14   (B) (2008); see also NMSA 1978, § 62-8-1 (1941) (“Every rate made, demanded or\n\n15   received by any public utility shall be just and reasonable.”); cf. § 62-16-2(A)(4)\n\n16   (“[P]ublic utilities should be able to recover their reasonable costs incurred to\n\n17   procure or generate energy from renewable energy resources . . . .”).\n\n18   {41}   Against this backdrop, Rule 572.22 first ensures that any incentive awarded\n\n19   under the REA will comply with the statute by encouraging a utility to produce or\n\n\n                                                30\n\f 1   acquire renewable energy that accomplishes one or more of the REA’s statutory\n\n 2   bases for an incentive. See 17.9.572.22(A), (B) NMAC (5/4/2021); see also § 62-\n\n 3   16-4(D). The utility then must demonstrate “that the terms and duration of the\n\n 4   proposed incentive . . . are just and reasonable in light of the utility’s costs, its\n\n 5   authorized return, and the magnitude of any other incentives that have been\n\n 6   authorized by the commission.” 17.9.572.22(C) NMAC (5/4/2021). The utility also\n\n 7   must show that the measure proposed to support the incentive will be a cost-effective\n\n8    investment as compared with the “value of the corresponding reduction in carbon\n\n9    dioxide or other emissions.” 17.9.572.22(D) NMAC (5/4/2021).\n\n10   {42}   This framework implements the REA’s incentive and rulemaking\n\n11   requirements in a manner that comports with the PRC’s broad mandate to regulate\n\n12   public utilities to ensure “that reasonable and proper services shall be available at\n\n13   fair, just and reasonable rates.” Section 62-3-1(B). Given that an incentive will\n\n14   compensate a utility at the expense of ratepayers, we hold that the PRC acted within\n\n15   its authority by requiring an incentive to be just and reasonable and based on a cost-\n\n16   effective investment. Cf. Att’y Gen. v. N.M. Pub. Regul. Comm’n, 2011-NMSC-034,\n\n17   ¶¶ 11, 13, 150 N.M. 174, 258 P.3d 453 (concluding that an “adder” that allows a\n\n18   utility to “receive additional revenue as compensation for reducing the consumption\n\n19   of their energy” is a rate and therefore requires a balancing of interests to ensure that\n\n\n                                                31\n\f 1   it is “‘just and reasonable’” (quoting Section 62-8-1)). Moreover, we defer to the\n\n 2   PRC’s chosen standard for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of an investment—the\n\n 3   cost of the investment versus the value of the corresponding reduction of carbon\n\n 4   dioxide or other emissions—as a reasonable exercise of policy-making authority that\n\n 5   promotes the legislative directive to make “[r]easonable and consistent progress”\n\n 6   toward reaching the zero carbon resource standard by 2045. Section 62-16-4(A)(6);\n\n 7   see also New Energy Econ., 2018-NMSC-024, ¶ 25.\n\n 8   {43}   The cases cited by SPS do not compel a different conclusion. In particular,\n\n 9   SPS cites State ex rel. Sandel v. N.M. Pub. Util. Comm’n, 1999-NMSC-019, ¶ 26,\n\n10   127 N.M. 272, 980 P.2d 55, to argue that the PRC “usurp[ed] the Legislature’s law-\n\n11   making and policy-setting authority” by adopting Rule 572.22(D). We held in\n\n12   Sandel that the PRC’s predecessor, the Public Utility Commission, violated Article\n\n13   III, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution “by undertaking to deregulate the\n\n14   electric power industry in New Mexico in a manner that is beyond the scope of the\n\n15   authority granted . . . by the Legislature.” Sandel, 1999-NMSC-019, ¶ 26. We\n\n16   reached that conclusion based on the Commission’s actions to “carry out broad\n\n17   changes in public policy by replacing regulation under the ‘just and reasonable’\n\n18   standard with competition in an open marketplace,” id. ¶ 19, at a time when\n\n19   deregulation was being debated at both the state and federal levels, id. ¶ 8. Here, the\n\n\n                                               32\n\f 1   PRC has not attempted a controversial change in public policy vis-à-vis its\n\n 2   fundamental responsibility to ensure just and reasonable rates. Rather, the PRC has\n\n 3   adopted a rule that implements the REA’s incentive provision, consistent with the\n\n 4   PRC’s traditional exercise of its regulatory authority. Sandel is thus inapposite.\n\n 5   {44}   In sum, the PRC must carry out its duty to establish just and reasonable rates\n\n 6   absent a clear statement to the contrary. See, e.g., Hobbs Gas Co. v. N.M. Pub. Serv.\n\n 7   Comm’n, 1980-NMSC-005, ¶ 4, 94 N.M. 731, 616 P.2d 1116 (“The law . . . charges\n\n 8   the Commission with the responsibility of [e]nsuring that every rate made or\n\n 9   received by a public utility shall be just and reasonable.”). The cost-benefit analysis\n\n10   requirement in Section 62-16-4(B)(3) does not relieve the PRC from ensuring that\n\n11   an incentive awarded at ratepayers’ expense is just and reasonable. To the contrary,\n\n12   it mandates that the PRC consider “unreasonable impacts to customer electricity\n\n13   bills” in achieving the 2040 and 2045 RPS standards. Id. (emphasis added). That\n\n14   mandate is broad enough to encompass a cost-benefit requirement that precludes the\n\n15   award of an incentive unless the utility demonstrates a benefit to ratepayers that\n\n16   ensures progress toward the zero carbon resource standard.\n\n17   c.     SPS’s remaining challenges to Rule 572.22(D) fail\n\n18   {45}   SPS’s two remaining challenges to Rule 572.22(D) also fail. First, SPS argues\n\n19   that the cost-benefit provision in Rule 572.22(D) was adopted without notice and\n\n\n                                               33\n\f 1   comment, in violation of due process. We readily dispense with this argument. The\n\n 2   PRC’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking included a draft of proposed Rule 572.22\n\n 3   that “request[ed] that all comments include a proposal on how best to calculate a\n\n 4   financial incentive.” SPS proposed a method of calculating a financial incentive that\n\n 5   the PRC ultimately declined to adopt. Instead, the PRC adopted the cost-benefit\n\n 6   requirement that was proposed by Occidental Permian Limited, Ltd. (Occidental) in\n\n 7   its initial comment to the proposed rule. Significantly, SPS submitted a written\n\n 8   comment on Occidental’s proposed requirement, stating that it “is an ambiguous,\n\n 9   arbitrary, and capricious limitation found nowhere in the statute.” SPS thus had\n\n10   notice that the PRC was considering a method of calculating a financial incentive,\n\n11   had an opportunity to propose its own method, and had an opportunity to comment\n\n12   on the very language that the PRC eventually adopted. Under these circumstances,\n\n13   SPS’s claimed due process violation rings hollow. See, e.g., Rivas v. Bd. of\n\n14   Cosmetologists, 1984-NMSC-076, ¶ 9, 101 N.M. 592, 686 P.2d 934 (“Case law\n\n15   suggests that the minimum protections upon which administrative action may be\n\n16   based, [are] according to interested parties a simple notice and right to comment.”\n\n17   (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n18   {46}   Second, SPS argues that Rule 572.22(D) provisions for calculating the costs\n\n19   and benefits supporting an incentive application are void for vagueness. In\n\n\n                                               34\n\f 1   particular, SPS challenges the requirement to provide “the cost of the measures\n\n 2   implemented by the utility that resulted in the lower carbon dioxide emissions.”\n\n 3   17.9.572.22(D)(4) NMAC (5/4/2021). SPS similarly challenges the requirement to\n\n 4   provide “the estimated value of the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions . . . based\n\n 5   on an analysis of relevant carbon dioxide markets.” 17.9.572.22(D)(3) NMAC\n\n 6   (5/4/2021). SPS argues that, without greater specificity, the rule “requires utilities to\n\n 7   guess at its meaning and is impermissibly vague.” We disagree. “A court\n\n 8   entertaining a pre-enforcement challenge to a regulation that does not implicate\n\n 9   constitutionally protected conduct such as the First Amendment right to freedom of\n\n10   expression may sustain a vagueness challenge only if the law ‘is impermissibly\n\n11   vague in all of its applications.’” N.M. Petroleum Marketers Ass’n v. N.M. Env’t\n\n12   Improvement Bd., 2007-NMCA-060, ¶ 16, 141 N.M. 678, 160 P.3d 587 (quoting\n\n13   Vill. of Hoffman Ests. v. The Flipside, Hoffman Ests., Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 495\n\n14   (1982)). Here, by SPS’s own account, it understood Rule 572.22(D) well enough to\n\n15   submit “all the information required by that subsection” to support its proposal for\n\n16   an incentive. SPS’s ability to comprehend the rule’s requirements undermines its\n\n17   argument that the rule “is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\f 1   2.     SPS’s void-for-vagueness challenges lack merit\n\n 2   {47}   Continuing with the void-for-vagueness theme, SPS challenges three other\n\n 3   provisions of Rule 572 on vagueness grounds. First, SPS argues that the rule’s\n\n 4   definition of the term “financial incentive” is unconstitutionally vague. See\n\n 5   17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (5/4/2021). SPS maintains that the definition’s use of the\n\n 6   terms “capital investment opportunities,” “certain behaviors or actions,” and “would\n\n 7   not otherwise have occurred” are confusing, ambiguous, and require utilities to guess\n\n 8   at their meanings. Second, SPS argues that the definition of “procure” and\n\n 9   “procurement” is ambiguous “to the extent it does not comport with the Amended\n\n10   Rule’s actual use of the term ‘procurement.’” See 17.9.572.7(P)(4) NMAC\n\n11   (5/4/2021). SPS argues that the Amended Rule “defines procurement to mean a\n\n12   bidding process, but the rule subsequently uses the term to refer to the cost of the\n\n13   generation purchased rather than the bidding process itself” and then cites, as an\n\n14   example, “17.9.572.12(C) NMAC (5/4/2021) (‘To the extent a procurement is\n\n15   greater than the reasonable cost threshold and results in excess costs . . . .’).” SPS\n\n16   argues that the actual use of the term procurement relative to the definition provided\n\n17   in the rule is “inconsistent and confusing” and “renders the definition vague and\n\n18   unenforceable.” Third, SPS challenges the provision that requires a public utility to\n\n19   give a preference to renewable energy generated in New Mexico in limited\n\n\n                                              36\n\f 1   circumstances. See 17.9.572.10(A) NMAC (5/4/2021) (“Other factors being equal,\n\n 2   preference shall be given to renewable energy generated in New Mexico.”). SPS\n\n 3   argues that the requirement for a preference when “[o]ther factors [are] equal” fails\n\n 4   to identify what those factors may be and as such, the provision requires utilities to\n\n 5   guess at its meaning and is impermissibly vague. See id.\n\n 6   {48}   Although these provisions have not been drafted with perfect clarity, they are\n\n 7   sufficient for due process purposes. As our Court of Appeals has cogently explained,\n\n 8   “An agency drafting regulations is not required to write for the benefit of deliberately\n\n 9   unsympathetic or willfully obtuse readers: for purposes of due process, a\n\n10   governmental agency attempting to give notice to members of the public may\n\n11   assume a hypothetical recipient desirous of actually being informed.” N.M.\n\n12   Petroleum Marketers, 2007-NMCA-060, ¶ 18 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\n13   omitted). Here, SPS objects to language that readily informs a public utility about\n\n14   the PRC’s intended meaning. SPS itself was able to understand the PRC’s intended\n\n15   meaning and was able to apply the first two provisions it challenges⸻financial\n\n16   incentives and procurements⸺in its incentive application without difficulty. We are\n\n17   thus unpersuaded that the challenged provisions are “impermissibly vague in all of\n\n18   [their] applications.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                               37\n\f 1   3.     The Amended Rule’s preference for renewable energy generated in New\n 2          Mexico is not unlawful\n\n 3   {49}   SPS challenges the Amended Rule’s preference for renewable energy\n\n 4   generated in New Mexico, 17.9.572.10(A) NMAC (5/4/2021), as (1) exceeding the\n\n 5   scope of the REA, (2) unlawfully discriminating against citizens of other states in\n\n 6   violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const, art. IV, § 2, cl. 1, and\n\n 7   (3) violating the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.\n\n 8   {50}   As for exceeding the scope of the REA, we reiterate that the PRC is not\n\n 9   precluded from exceeding the REA’s requirements on matters of public policy\n\n10   specifically entrusted to the PRC’s discretion and expertise. See New Energy Econ.,\n\n11   2018-NMSC-024, ¶ 25. The REA directs the PRC to promulgate rules to implement\n\n12   the Act and its objectives, § 62-16-9, including rules to implement the legislative\n\n13   finding that “the use of renewable energy by public utilities subject to commission\n\n14   oversight in accordance with the [REA] can bring significant economic benefits to\n\n15   New Mexico,” § 62-16-2(A)(2). Stating, in 17.9.572.10(A) NMAC (5/4/2021), a\n\n16   narrow preference for renewable energy generated in New Mexico—in the unlikely\n\n17   circumstance of “[o]ther factors being equal”—is a reasonable exercise of the PRC’s\n\n18   mandate to implement the Act in a manner that is economically beneficial to New\n\n19   Mexico when lawful and appropriate.\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\f 1   {51}   Turning to SPS’s unlawful discrimination argument, we note that this\n\n 2   argument is largely undeveloped and is not supported by SPS’s lone citation of\n\n 3   United Building & Construction Trades Council v. Mayor & Council of City of\n\n 4   Camden, 465 U.S. 208 (1984). Unlike the requirement in United Building that at\n\n 5   least forty percent of the employees of city contractors and subcontractors must be\n\n 6   local residents, see id. at 210, the Amended Rule’s preference does not require any\n\n 7   of a utility’s renewable energy to be generated in New Mexico. “Other factors being\n\n 8   equal,” 17.9.572.10(A) NMAC (5/4/2021), the preference merely acts as a tie-\n\n 9   breaker. SPS cites no authority that such a tie-breaker amounts to unlawful\n\n10   discrimination against the citizens of other states under the Privileges and\n\n11   Immunities Clause, and we therefore assume that none exists. See Lee v. Lee (In re\n\n12   Doe), 1984-NMSC-024, ¶ 2, 100 N.M. 764, 676 P.2d 1329 (“We assume where\n\n13   arguments in briefs are unsupported by cited authority, counsel after diligent search,\n\n14   was unable to find any supporting authority.”).\n\n15   {52}   That the challenged preference is a mere tie-breaker also distinguishes it from\n\n16   the cases cited by SPS in support of its similarly undeveloped argument under the\n\n17   dormant Commerce Clause. See Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 440-41, 461\n\n18   (1992) (holding that the Commerce Clause was violated by a statute requiring ten\n\n19   percent of coal burned in Oklahoma power plants to be mined in-state); New England\n\n\n                                              39\n\f 1   Power Co. v. New Hampshire, 455 U.S. 331, 339, 344 (1982) (holding that the\n\n 2   Commerce Clause was violated by an order prohibiting a utility from selling\n\n 3   hydroelectric energy outside the State of New Hampshire); New Energy Co. of Ind.\n\n 4   v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 273, 280 (1988) (holding that the Commerce Clause was\n\n 5   violated by a statute awarding tax credits to ethanol producers only if the ethanol\n\n 6   was produced in Ohio or in a state that granted similar tax advantages to ethanol\n\n 7   produced in Ohio). Unlike the statutes in those cases, the Amended Rule’s\n\n 8   preference neither discriminates against interstate commerce nor imposes a burden\n\n 9   on such commerce that “is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local\n\n10   benefits.” See Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). Again, SPS\n\n11   cites no authority that a mere tie-breaker discriminates against or unlawfully burdens\n\n12   interstate commerce. Assuming no such authority exists, we conclude that the\n\n13   Amended Rule’s preference is not unreasonable or unlawful. See In re Doe, 1984-\n\n14   NMSC-024, ¶ 2.\n\n15   4.     Rule 572.22(E) does not exceed the scope of the REA by including a cost\n16          cap on incentives\n\n17   {53}   SPS argues that the Amended Rule’s cost cap on incentives exceeds the scope\n\n18   of the REA. Specifically, SPS challenges Rule 572.22(E), which provides, “The total\n\n19   financial incentive authorized for recovery in rates pursuant to this section shall not\n\n20   exceed the product (expressed in dollars) of: (1) the utility’s annual weighted\n\n                                               40\n\f 1   average cost of capital (expressed as a percent)[] and (2) the cost of the measures\n\n 2   described in Subsection B of this section.” 17.9.572.22(E) NMAC (5/4/2021). SPS\n\n 3   argues that this cap unduly limits the availability of incentives beyond the lone cost\n\n 4   cap actually established in the statute, which “protect[s] public utilities and their\n\n 5   ratepayers from renewable energy costs that are above a reasonable cost threshold.”\n\n 6   Section 62-16-2(B)(3); see also § 62-16-3(E) (establishing a reasonable cost\n\n 7   threshold of $60 per megawatt-hour of renewable energy with adjustments for\n\n 8   inflation after 2020).\n\n 9   {54}   As an initial matter, we note that the challenged provision does not establish\n\n10   a cap at all; rather, it ensures that any incentive is cost-based and justly and\n\n11   reasonably related to a utility’s approved weighted average percentage cost of\n\n12   capital. See, e.g., N.M. Att’y Gen., 2011-NMSC-034, ¶ 18 (holding that the adoption\n\n13   of rates was “arbitrary and unlawful in that they were not evidence-based, cost-\n\n14   based, nor utility specific”). We further note that SPS proposed an arbitrary incentive\n\n15   cap of $10 million in its initial comments to the proposed rule as part of its proposed\n\n16   method of calculating a financial incentive. SPS never withdrew its proposed cap or\n\n17   otherwise alerted the PRC to the argument that it raises on appeal. We therefore\n\n18   decline to address this argument further.\n\n19   5.     Rule 572.11 does not unreasonably or unlawfully restrict the application\n20          of the REA\n\n                                                 41\n\f 1   {55}   SPS next challenges the PRC’s adoption of Rule 572.11 as unreasonable and\n\n 2   unlawful. Rule 572.11 codifies one of the seven requirements set forth in Section\n\n 3   62-16-4(B) that govern how the PRC shall administer the eighty percent and one\n\n 4   hundred percent RPS requirements. Specifically, Rule 572.11 codifies the\n\n 5   requirement that the PRC shall, “in consultation with the department of environment,\n\n 6   ensure that the standard does not result in material increases to greenhouse gas\n\n 7   emissions from entities not subject to commission oversight and regulation.” Section\n\n 8   62-16-4(B)(6); see 17.9.572.11 NMAC (5/4/2021) (“After consultation with the\n\n 9   department of environment, the commission may not approve a public utility’s\n\n10   annual [REA] plan that result[s] in material increases to greenhouse gas emissions\n\n11   from entities not subject to commission oversight and regulation.”). SPS argues that,\n\n12   because the PRC did not codify the other six requirements set forth in the statute, the\n\n13   Amended Rule “selectively implement[s] the REA” and “limit[s] the application of\n\n14   [the REA] through the adoption of a regulation.” Intervenors, in their Joint Answer\n\n15   Brief, agree that the PRC’s “unexplained inclusion of one consideration in Section\n\n16   62-16-4(B) and exclusion of the remainder is unreasonable and should be annulled\n\n17   and vacated.”\n\n18   {56}   We disagree with the position of SPS and Intervenors that the PRC’s inclusion\n\n19   of only one of the requirements set forth in Section 62-16-4(B) requires annulling\n\n\n                                               42\n\f 1   and vacating the order approving the Amended Rule. Neither SPS nor Intervenors\n\n 2   cite authority requiring the PRC to take an all-or-nothing approach to codifying\n\n 3   multiple requirements set forth in a single, relevant statute. We therefore assume that\n\n 4   no such authority exists. See In re Doe, 1984-NMSC-024, ¶ 2 (“Issues raised in\n\n 5   appellate briefs which are unsupported by cited authority will not be reviewed by us\n\n 6   on appeal.”). Moreover, the Amended Rule’s language does not contradict or\n\n 7   otherwise conflict with the substantially identical language in the statute and does\n\n 8   not relieve the PRC from the remainder of its duties under the statute. Cf. NMSA\n\n 9   1978, § 14-4-5.7(A) (2017) (“A conflict between a rule and a statute is resolved in\n\n10   favor of the statute.”).\n\n11   6.     The PRC did not act unreasonably or unlawfully by “adopting the\n12          Amended Rule after it bifurcated critical matters from the rulemaking”\n\n13   {57}   SPS argues that the PRC acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it “bifurcated\n\n14   critical matters from the rulemaking” and it “transfer[ed] controversial issues to a\n\n15   separate rulemaking and subject[ed] utilities to a confusing, ambiguous, and vague\n\n16   rule.” Specifically, SPS contends that the PRC lacked authority to adopt the\n\n17   Amended Rule without addressing (1) the definition of the phrase “capital\n\n18   investment opportunities” in the definition of financial incentive, (2) whether a\n\n19   financial incentive would be available to advance the closure of the four corners\n\n20   nuclear facility, (3) whether the one hundred percent zero carbon standard includes\n\n                                               43\n\f 1   the 2040 RPS standard of eighty percent renewables and limits nuclear to twenty\n\n 2   percent, (4) whether Arizona Public Service could apply for a financial incentive as\n\n3    a nonregulated entity for the four corners nuclear facility, and (5) how the “average\n\n4    annual levelized cost” of energy should be calculated for purposes of the reasonable\n\n5    cost threshold definition set forth in Section 62-16-3(E).\n\n 6   {58}   The lone authority that SPS cites in support of this argument is a federal\n\n 7   district court case that granted a preliminary injunction against the implementation\n\n 8   of a rule that was adopted through a “staggered rulemaking” process. See Centro\n\n 9   Legal de la Raza v. Exec. Off. for Immigr. Rev., 524 F. Supp. 3d 919, 954-55 (N.D.\n\n10   Cal. 2021). The circumstances of Centro Legal de la Raza are clearly\n\n11   distinguishable. In particular, the rulemaking in this case and the subsequent\n\n12   rulemaking that resulted in the Second Amended Rule were held in a sequential,\n\n13   orderly manner with full public notice of both proceedings and ample opportunity\n\n14   for public participation. Contra id. at 958 (holding that the agency’s rushed and\n\n15   overlapping rulemakings and decisions “deprived the public of the opportunity to\n\n16   consider how these rules intersected and impacted the Rule, and also raise[d] serious\n\n17   questions about whether the agency meaningfully addressed the interaction of these\n\n18   rules.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). SPS’s contention does not\n\n19   withstand scrutiny.\n\n\n                                              44\n\f 1   7.     SPS’s remaining arguments are moot\n\n2    a.     A reasonable cost threshold analysis is not required for existing\n3           procurements\n\n 4   {59}   SPS challenges the provision of the Amended Rule that implemented the\n\n 5   REA’s “reasonable cost threshold” (RCT) of sixty dollars per megawatt-hour that\n\n 6   was established by the Legislature in 2019. See § 62-16-4(E) (providing that a\n\n 7   “public utility shall not be required to incur” costs above the RCT to procure or\n\n 8   generate renewable energy to comply with the RPS); § 62-16-3(E) (defining\n\n 9   “reasonable cost threshold”). SPS argues that the Amended Rule’s requirement to\n\n10   include an RCT analysis for existing renewable energy procurements applies the\n\n11   RCT retroactively and is therefore unlawful. See 17.9.572.12(B) NMAC (5/4/2021)\n\n12   (providing that a public utility “shall include in its annual [REA] plan [an RCT]\n\n13   analysis by procurement, existing or proposed, for the plan year” (emphasis added));\n\n14   see also, e.g., Howell v. Heim, 1994-NMSC-103, ¶ 17, 118 N.M. 500, 882 P.2d 541\n\n15   (“New Mexico law presumes that statutes and rules apply prospectively absent a\n\n16   clear intention to the contrary.”). However, the Second Amended Rule removed the\n\n17   reference to “existing” procurements and now requires an RCT analysis only for\n\n18   “proposed” procurements. Compare 17.9.572.12(A) NMAC (2/28/2023) with\n\n19   17.9.572.12(B) NMAC (5/4/2021). And as we have already determined, the PRC\n\n20   denied SPS’s incentive application under Section 62-16-4(D) and did not rely on\n\n                                             45\n\f 1   Rule 572.12(B). A ruling on this issue therefore would not “grant actual relief,” and\n\n 2   accordingly the issue is moot. Gunaji v. Macias, 2001-NMSC-028, ¶ 9, 130 N.M.\n\n 3   734, 31 P.3d 1008 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also KOB-\n\n 4   TV, L.L.C. v. City of Albuquerque, 2005-NMCA-049, ¶ 37, 137 N.M. 388, 111 P.3d\n\n 5   708 (“[W]hen legislation is enacted that resolves a conflict, a question concerning\n\n 6   the conflict addressed to a court will be moot.”).\n\n 7   b.     The typographical error in Rule 572.12(C) has been corrected\n\n 8   {60}   SPS argues that the order approving the Amended Rule must be vacated and\n\n 9   annulled because of a typographical error in the Amended Rule that “states the exact\n\n10   opposite of the REA.” Compare § 62-16-4(E) (“The provisions of this subsection do\n\n11   not preclude a public utility from accepting a project with a cost that would exceed\n\n12   the [RCT].” (emphasis added)) with 17.9.572.12(C) NMAC (5/4/2021) (“The\n\n13   provisions of this rule do preclude a public utility from accepting a project with a\n\n14   cost that would exceed the [RCT].” (emphasis added)). However, the Second\n\n15   Amended Rule corrected the error such that the current rule is now consistent with\n\n16   the statute. See 17.9.572.12(B) NMAC (2/28/2023). Nonetheless, SPS continues to\n\n17   press the issue because the PRC denied SPS’s incentive application based on the\n\n18   “flawed rule.” We disagree. The PRC reasonably and lawfully denied SPS’s\n\n19   incentive application irrespective of the Amended Rule’s “flawed” RCT provision,\n\n\n                                              46\n\f 1   which has now been corrected. This issue is therefore moot. See Gunaji, 2001-\n\n 2   NMSC-028, ¶ 9; KOB-TV, 2005-NMCA-049, ¶ 37.\n\n 3   c.     No controversy exists about whether the Amended Rule requires a new\n 4          competitive selection process for existing resources\n\n 5   {61}   SPS challenges the Amended Rule’s provision implementing a new\n\n 6   competitive bidding requirement established by the 2019 amendments to the REA\n\n 7   that applies to procurements for “new renewable energy” beginning on July 1, 2020.\n\n 8   See 17.9.572.13 NMAC (5/4/2021); see also § 62-16-4(G)(1), (3). SPS argues, “To\n\n 9   the extent the rule allows for application of the competitive procurement requirement\n\n10   to existing, previously approved resources, it is inconsistent with the REA.”\n\n11   (Emphasis added.) The PRC agrees that the competitive procurement requirement\n\n12   does not apply to “previously approved procurements” and maintains that neither\n\n13   the Amended Rule nor the Second Amended Rule provides otherwise. See\n\n14   17.9.572.13 NMAC (5/4/2021 & 2/28/2023). We see no actual controversy on this\n\n15   issue. We agree with the parties that Section 62-16-4(F) and (G) impose distinct and\n\n16   different requirements on renewable-energy procurements proposed before and after\n\n17   July 1, 2020—with only the latter subject to a competitive procurement process. The\n\n18   Amended Rule does not provide to the contrary and does not require us to disturb\n\n19   the order adopting the Amended Rule. See, e.g., Tenneco Oil Co. v. N.M. Water\n\n20   Quality Control Comm’n, 1987-NMCA-153, ¶ 14, 107 N.M. 469, 760 P.2d 161\n\n                                              47\n\f 1   (“Rules and regulations enacted by an agency are presumed valid and will be upheld\n\n 2   if reasonably consistent with the statutes that they implement.”), superseded by\n\n 3   statute on other grounds as stated in N.M. Mining Ass’n v. N.M. Water Quality\n\n 4   Control Comm’n, 2007-NMCA-010, ¶ 19, 141 N.M. 41, 150 P.3d 991.\n\n 5   III.   CONCLUSION\n\n 6   {62}   SPS has failed to meet its burden to show that the PRC’s orders adopting the\n\n 7   Amended Rule and denying SPS’s 2021 request for a financial incentive were\n\n 8   unreasonable or unlawful. We therefore affirm both orders.\n\n 9   {63}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n10\n11                                                DAVID K. THOMSON, Justice\n\n12   WE CONCUR:\n\n13\n14   C.

See NMSA 1978, § 62-16-4(D) (2019) (providing\n\n 7   for the award of “financial or other incentives”); Renewable Energy Act, NMSA\n\n 8   1978, §§ 62-16-1 to -10 (2004, as amended through 2021) (the REA or the Act)1.\n\n 9   We then consider SPS’s numerous facial challenges to the PRC’s April 2021 order.\n\n10   That order adopted 2021 amendments to Rule 572 (the Amended Rule)⸺regulations\n\n11   implementing the PRC’s duties under the REA’s 2019 amendments, including the\n\n\n\n\n           1\n             The REA’s 2019 amendment is relevant to this opinion. The current (2021)\n     REA consists of two statutes from 2007, seven from 2019, and one⸺ Section 62-\n     16-5⸻enacted in 2019 and amended in 2021 by the addition of Subsection (B)(1)(d)\n     (on which this opinion does not rely). Accordingly in this opinion, all nondated\n     references to the REA or to the Act and all citations of statutes therein are supported\n     fully by the current enactments.\n\f 1   duty to award an incentive when appropriate.2 See Renewable Energy for Electric\n\n 2   Utilities, 17.9.572 NMAC (5/4/2021, as amended through 2/28/2023); 17.9.572.22\n\n 3   NMAC (5/4/2021) (setting forth requirements to apply for an incentive).\n\n 4   {2}   We hold that SPS’s proposed retirement of banked, renewable energy\n\n 5   certificates (RECs) to exceed the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) was\n\n 6   insufficient to qualify for an incentive under the REA because the proposed\n\n 7   retirement would not have “produce[d] or acquire[d] renewable energy” as required\n\n 8   by Section 62-16-4(D). 3 See § 62-16-3(G) (“‘[REC]’ means a certificate or other\n\n 9   record . . . that represents all the environmental attributes from one megawatt-hour\n\n10   of electricity generated from renewable energy.”); § 62-16-3(I) (“‘[RPS]’ means the\n\n11   minimum percentage of retail sales of electricity by a public utility . . . that is\n\n12   required by the [REA] to be from renewable energy . . . .”). Our conclusion is based\n\n\n\n           2\n             SPS has filed two additional appeals that separately challenge the PRC’s\n     subsequent orders denying SPS’s application for a financial incentive for 2023 and\n     approving further amendments to Rule 572 in February 2023 (the Second Amended\n     Rule). See S-1-SC-39733; S-1-SC-39796; see also 17.9.572 NMAC (2/28/2023).\n     We have consolidated and held in abeyance those appeals pending the outcome of\n     this proceeding.\n           3\n             We use the phrase “banked REC” throughout this opinion to refer to an REC\n     that represents renewable energy generated in a year before the year in which the\n     REC is retired. See § 62-16-5(B)(4) (providing that an REC “may be carried forward\n     for up to four years from the date of issuance to establish compliance with the [RPS],\n     after which [the REC] shall be deemed retired”).\n\n                                               2\n\f 1   on the statute’s plain language, which is consistent with the REA’s clear legislative\n\n 2   intent to require public utilities to procure sufficient renewable energy resources to\n\n 3   reduce carbon emissions and achieve the zero carbon resource standard by 2045. See\n\n 4   § 62-16-4(A) (providing public utilities with a sequence of increasingly renewable,\n\n5    energy benchmarks to achieve by 2045); § 62-16-3(K) (“‘[Z]ero carbon resource’\n\n6    means an electricity generation resource that emits no carbon dioxide into the\n\n 7   atmosphere . . . as a result of electricity production.”).\n\n 8   {3}   We also hold that the challenged provisions of the Amended Rule (1) do not\n\n 9   exceed the scope of the REA; (2) are not arbitrary, capricious, or void for vagueness;\n\n10   and (3) are not otherwise unreasonable or unlawful. We therefore affirm the PRC in\n\n11   all respects. See NMSA 1978, § 62-11-5 (1982) (“The supreme court shall vacate\n\n12   and annul the order complained of if it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the\n\n13   court that the order is unreasonable or unlawful.”).\n\n14   I.    BACKGROUND\n\n15   {4}   SPS’s primary objection is to the PRC’s approach to awarding incentives\n\n16   under the REA and the Amended Rule and the resulting denial of SPS’s incentive\n\n17   application. We therefore begin with an overview of the REA and its incentive\n\n18   provision and the PRC’s 2021 amendments to Rule 572, before summarizing SPS’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f 1   incentive request and the PRC’s reasons for denial. We then address SPS’s\n\n 2   arguments in turn.\n\n 3   A.    Overview of the REA and the 2021 Amendments to Rule 572\n\n 4   {5}   Section 62-16-4 is the heart of the REA. Among other things, the provision\n\n 5   establishes the RPS and the related requirements for public utilities to meet that\n\n 6   standard. See id.; see also § 62-16-3(I). Before 2019, Section 62-16-4 set forth a\n\n 7   series of increasing RPS benchmarks culminating in a requirement for public utilities\n\n 8   to supply at least twenty percent of retail electricity sales from renewable energy by\n\n 9   2020. See § 62-16-4(A)(1)(a)-(d) (2014); see also § 62-16-3(F) (“‘[R]enewable\n\n10   energy’ means electric energy generated by use of renewable energy resources and\n\n11   delivered to a public utility.”). In 2019, the Legislature extended the sequence of\n\n12   RPS benchmarks intended to achieve the ambitious zero carbon resource standard\n\n13   by 2045. See § 62-16-4(A)(1)-(6); see also § 62-16-3(L) (“‘[Z]ero carbon resource\n\n14   standard’ means providing New Mexico public utility customers with electricity\n\n15   generated from one hundred percent zero carbon resources.”). At present, renewable\n\n16   energy must make up at least twenty percent of a utility’s retail sales, which will\n\n17   increase to a minimum of forty percent by 2025, fifty percent by 2030, and eighty\n\n18   percent by 2040. See § 62-16-4(A)(2)-(5). In addition to these intermediate\n\n19   benchmarks, the Legislature mandated that “[r]easonable and consistent progress\n\n\n                                               4\n\f1    shall be made over time toward [the] requirement” of supplying one hundred percent\n\n2    of retail electricity sales in New Mexico from zero carbon resources by 2045. Section\n\n3    62-16-4(A)(6).\n\n 4   {6}   Section 62-16-4 also prescribes the manner in which a public utility must\n\n 5   comply with the RPS. To comply, a utility must retire enough RECs annually to\n\n 6   “meet the [RPS] requirements” relative to the utility’s total retail sales of electricity.\n\n 7   See § 62-16-4(A); see also § 62-16-5(A)(1) (providing that the PRC shall establish\n\n 8   “a system of [RECs] that can be used by a public utility to establish compliance with\n\n 9   the [RPS]”). One REC represents one megawatt-hour of electricity generated from\n\n10   renewable energy and “may be carried forward for up to four years from the date of\n\n11   issuance to establish compliance with the [RPS], after which [the REC] shall be\n\n12   deemed retired.” Section 62-16-5(B)(4); see § 62-16-3(G). Thus, any excess RECs\n\n13   that are not retired in the same year they are earned may be banked for up to four\n\n14   years and used to meet a utility’s annual RPS obligation during that period. In\n\n15   addition, excess RECs “may be traded, sold or otherwise transferred by their owner,\n\n16   unless the certificates are from a rate-based public utility plant, in which case the\n\n17   entirety of the [RECs] from that plant shall be retired by the utility on behalf of itself\n\n18   or its customers.” Section 62-16-5(B)(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f 1   {7}   Of particular importance to this appeal, Section 62-16-4 also provides for the\n\n 2   award of “financial or other incentives” for exceeding the Act’s minimum\n\n 3   requirements. See § 62-16-4(D). Before 2019, the REA tasked the PRC with\n\n 4   “provid[ing] appropriate performance-based financial or other incentives to\n\n 5   encourage public utilities to acquire renewable energy supplies that exceed the\n\n 6   applicable annual [RPS].” Section 62-16-4(A)(4) (2007); see also § 62-16-2(A)(5)\n\n 7   (2007) (“The legislature finds that . . . a public utility should have incentives to go\n\n 8   beyond the minimum requirements of the [RPS] . . . .”). The 2019 amendments to\n\n 9   Section 62-16-4 elaborated on the bases for which an incentive may be awarded:\n\n10         [T]he commission shall . . . develop and provide financial or other\n11         incentives to encourage public utilities to produce or acquire renewable\n12         energy that exceeds the applicable annual [RPS] set forth in this section;\n13         results in reductions in carbon dioxide emissions earlier than required\n14         by Subsection A of this section; or causes a reduction in the generation\n15         of electricity by coal-fired generating facilities, including coal-fired\n16         generating facilities located outside of New Mexico.\n\n17   Section 62-16-4(D). Where the pre-2019 Act allowed incentives “to encourage\n\n18   public utilities to acquire renewable energy supplies that exceed the applicable\n\n19   annual [RPS],” § 62-16-4(A)(4) (2007), the Act now allows incentives “to encourage\n\n20   public utilities to produce or acquire renewable energy” that exceeds the RPS, results\n\n21   in early reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, or reduces coal-fired generation, §\n\n22   62-16-4(D).\n\n\n                                               6\n\f 1   {8}   In response to the 2019 amendments to the REA, the PRC developed and\n\n 2   approved significant amendments to Rule 572, including by adding provisions that\n\n 3   govern the availability of incentives. See 17.9.572.22 NMAC (5/4/2021).4 Among\n\n 4   other things, the Amended Rule restates the general requirements set forth in Section\n\n 5   62-16-4(D) and articulates other, more specific requirements that a proposed course\n\n 6   of action must satisfy to qualify for an incentive. For example, an incentive is\n\n 7   available, by definition, “to encourage certain behaviors or actions that would not\n\n 8   otherwise have occurred in order to further the outcomes described in Section 62-\n\n 9   16-4 . . . .” See 17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (5/4/2021) (emphasis added).5 Similarly, an\n\n10   incentive “must be related to measures implemented by the utility after the effective\n\n11   date of this rule.” 17.9.572.22(B) NMAC (5/4/2021) (emphasis added). 6 And an\n\n12   incentive will not be awarded “with respect to a particular investment if the cost of\n\n\n\n\n           4\n            Previous versions of Rule 572 did not address the incentive provisions of the\n     Act. See generally 17.9.572 NMAC (5/31/2013); 17.9.572 NMAC (8/30/2007).\n           5\n            The 2023 amendments to Rule 572 do not affect this provision. See\n     17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (2/28/2023).\n           6\n              The Second Amended Rule amended this language as follows: “A financial\n     or other incentive proposed under [this section] shall be to encourage the public\n     utility to produce or to acquire renewable energy to accomplish, in the future, at least\n     one of the following purposes: . . . .” 17.9.572.22(B) NMAC (2/28/2023) (emphasis\n     added); see also 17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (5/4/2021) (“The financial incentive . . .\n     motivates certain behaviors or actions.”).\n\n                                                7\n\f 1   that investment exceeds the demonstrable value of the corresponding reduction in\n\n 2   carbon dioxide or other emissions.” 17.9.572.22(D) NMAC (5/4/2021). 7 The\n\n 3   Amended Rule also provides that an “interested person” may apply for an exemption\n\n 4   or variance from any of the rule’s requirements when inter alia a “proposed\n\n 5   alternative is in the public interest.” 17.9.572.21(G) NMAC (5/24/2021). 8 As these\n\n 6   provisions exemplify, the Amended Rule clarifies the circumstances in which an\n\n 7   incentive may be awarded under the REA. Whether that clarity is consistent with the\n\n 8   REA itself is one of the principal questions in this appeal.\n\n 9   B.    Procedural Background\n\n10   {9}   The PRC approved the Amended Rule in an April 2021 order, after an\n\n11   eighteen-month rulemaking aimed at implementing the 2019 amendments to the\n\n12   REA. SPS participated throughout the rulemaking process along with Public Service\n\n13   Company of New Mexico (PNM), El Paso Electric Company (EPE), PRC Utility\n\n14   Division Staff, and various nonutility entities and individuals. SPS timely appealed\n\n15   from the order adopting the Amended Rule, alleging numerous legal infirmities and\n\n16   asking the Court to vacate and annul the order.\n\n\n           The Second Amended Rule renumbered this provision and made minor\n           7\n\n     changes that do not affect its substance. See 17.9.572.22(E) NMAC (2/28/2023).\n           8\n             The Second Amended Rule made minor changes to this provision that do not\n     affect its substance. See 17.9.572.21(A), (B)(7) NMAC (2/28/2023).\n\n                                               8\n\f 1   {10}   Weeks later, SPS filed an application with the PRC under the REA and the\n\n 2   Amended Rule, seeking approvals of its 2022 Annual Renewable Energy Act Plan\n\n 3   and of several proposed rate riders for the same year. These matters were\n\n 4   uncontested and eventually approved by the PRC.\n\n 5   {11}   In the same application, SPS requested a financial incentive for which it\n\n 6   proposed to exceed its twenty percent RPS obligation and meet the forty percent\n\n 7   standard three years before it becomes mandatory as of 2025. Specifically, SPS\n\n 8   proposed to retire enough RECs in 2022, 2023, and 2024 to meet 2025’s forty\n\n 9   percent standard in each of those years. In return, SPS requested a rate rider that\n\n10   would allow it to charge customers one dollar for each REC that it would retire over\n\n11   the twenty percent standard. If approved, SPS projected that it would collect from\n\n12   ratepayers the additional amounts of $1.65 million in 2022; $1.74 million in 2023;\n\n13   and $1.84 million in 2024, for a three-year total incentive of approximately $5.23\n\n14   million. SPS represented that it would not retire “excess RECs early without an\n\n15   incentive to do so.” SPS also maintained that retiring excess RECs to meet the 2025\n\n16   standard “will necessitate that SPS procure more renewable energy resources earlier\n\n17   than would otherwise be needed in order to comply with the REA’s [RPS].”\n\n18   {12}   As a final part of the application, SPS requested a variance from the Amended\n\n19   Rule’s requirement to demonstrate that the cost of retiring extra RECs would not\n\n\n                                              9\n\f 1   exceed “the demonstrable value of the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or\n\n 2   other emissions.” 17.9.572.22(D) NMAC (5/4/2021). Conceding that the proposal\n\n 3   failed to meet that requirement, SPS argued that the requirement “is inconsistent\n\n 4   with the REA” and therefore requested a variance.\n\n 5   {13}   PRC Staff and three of the intervenors in the application proceeding9\n\n 6   “vigorously contested” SPS’s incentive proposal and variance request, both of which\n\n 7   the PRC later denied in an order filed in December 2021. The PRC was careful to\n\n 8   explain in the order that—although the request failed several provisions of the\n\n 9   Amended Rule—the denial was not based on the rule’s requirements. Rather, SPS\n\n10   failed to meet the threshold statutory requirement to qualify for an incentive: SPS\n\n11   “did not propose to ‘produce or acquire’ any renewable energy.” Section 62-16-\n\n12   4(D). The PRC found that SPS introduced “no evidence of any firm plans to acquire\n\n13   or produce any additional renewable energy.” Instead, “SPS only proposed to retire\n\n14   banked excess RECs earlier than it otherwise would [have].” That proposal was\n\n15   insufficient because, in the PRC’s view, “the retirement of RECs is a paper exercise\n\n16   or method by which RPS compliance is demonstrated” and not a proposal to produce\n\n\n            9\n             The three intervenors that opposed the incentive and variance were the New\n     Mexico Large Customer Group, Occidental Permian Ltd. (Occidental), and\n     Louisiana Energy Services. Having intervened in this appeal, these same parties filed\n     a joint answer brief in support of the PRC’s orders challenged by SPS.\n\n                                              10\n\f 1   or acquire renewable energy that exceeds the RPS “as required to be eligible for an\n\n 2   incentive under the statute.”\n\n 3   {14}   In addition to finding failure under Section 62-16-4(D), the PRC separately\n\n 4   concluded that SPS’s incentive application failed to satisfy the provisions of the\n\n 5   Amended Rule summarized above. Specifically, the PRC concluded that SPS’s\n\n 6   proposal did not merit an incentive because the RECs in question “are associated\n\n 7   with . . . existing renewable energy facilities, all of which [1] pre-date Rule 572.22\n\n 8   (contrary to Rule 572.22.B) and [2] were acquired for reasons other than those\n\n 9   contemplated in . . . Section 62-16-4(D) or Rule 572.22.” See 17.9.572.22(B)\n\n10   NMAC (5/4/2021) (providing that an incentive “must be related to measures\n\n11   implemented by the utility after the effective date of this rule” (emphasis added));\n\n12   17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (5/4/2021) (defining “financial incentive” as “money or\n\n13   additional earnings . . . to encourage certain behaviors or actions that would not\n\n14   otherwise have occurred in order to further the outcomes described in Section 62-\n\n15   16-4” (emphasis added)). The request also failed the Amended Rule’s requirement\n\n16   that the costs associated with retiring RECs must not exceed “the demonstrable value\n\n17   of the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions.”\n\n18   17.9.572.22(D) NMAC (5/4/2021). And as for SPS’s requested variance from the\n\n19   latter requirement, the PRC denied the variance as moot because the incentive\n\n\n                                              11\n\f 1   request “failed on many other grounds.” As previously noted however, these\n\n 2   conclusions were ancillary to the PRC’s determination that SPS’s incentive request\n\n 3   failed to produce or acquire renewable energy, as required by Section 62-16-4(D).\n\n 4   {15}   SPS timely appealed from the order denying its incentive request, and we\n\n 5   granted its subsequent motion to consolidate the appeal with its pending appeal\n\n 6   challenging the Amended Rule. We now proceed to the merits of both appeals.\n\n 7   II.    DISCUSSION\n\n 8   {16}   SPS’s core objection to both the Amended Rule and the denial of its incentive\n\n 9   request is the PRC’s interpretation of Section 62-16-4(D) to preclude the award of\n\n10   an incentive for exceeding the RPS by retiring RECs earlier than required by the\n\n11   Act. Because our resolution of this issue effectively disposes of SPS’s appeal by\n\n12   denial of its incentive application, we address it first. We then address SPS’s many\n\n13   remaining arguments against the Amended Rule. 10 As the party challenging the\n\n14   PRC’s orders, SPS has the burden of establishing that the orders are unreasonable or\n\n\n            10\n              The presentation of the issues in this appeal provides a case study as to why\n     the limitations the Legislature has placed on our review encourage trivial argument.\n     See § 62-11-5 (“The supreme court shall have no power to modify the action or order\n     appealed from, but shall either affirm or annul and vacate the same.”). We caution\n     parties that the better approach to advocacy is advancing only credible and\n     discernible claims of error. Tossing in the kitchen sink with the hope of vacating an\n     entire administrative ruling is an ill-conceived strategy that is wasteful of judicial\n     resources.\n\n                                              12\n\f 1   unlawful.

The PRC’s Denial of SPS’s Incentive Application Under Section 62-16-\n 8          4(D) Was Not Unreasonable or Unlawful\n\n 9   {17}   SPS challenges the denial of its incentive application under Section 62-16-\n\n10   4(D) on three grounds. First, SPS argues that the PRC’s interpretation of the statute\n\n11   “ignores the purpose and language of the REA and is consequently arbitrary and\n\n12   capricious, contrary to law, and an abuse of discretion.” In particular, SPS argues\n\n13   that conditioning the award of an incentive on a proposal that would “produce or\n\n14   acquire renewable energy,” § 62-16-4(D), “would lead to absurd results and thwart\n\n15   the Legislature’s intent to incentivize utilities to exceed the RPS.” Second, SPS\n\n16   argues that the availability of incentives under the REA since at least 2007 supports\n\n17   SPS’s proposed reading of the statute. Third, SPS argues that the PRC lacked\n\n18   sufficient evidence to support the hearing examiner’s finding of “speculative” that\n\n19   SPS’s early retirement of extra RECs would result in acquiring additional renewable\n\n20   energy resources earlier than otherwise necessary. We address each argument in\n\n                                              13\n\f 1   turn, and because our resolution of these issues is sufficient to affirm, we decline to\n\n 2   address SPS’s additional arguments related to the denial of its incentive application.\n\n 3   1.

The language\n\n 9   and structure of the statute support the PRC’s conclusion that Section 62-16-4(D) is\n\n10   “unequivocally clear” that an incentive must encourage a public utility, first and\n\n11   foremost, to “produce or acquire renewable energy.” The statute is similarly clear\n\n12   on exceeding the RPS, the focus of SPS’s argument, as a secondary objective that\n\n13   must be accomplished by the threshold requirement of producing or acquiring\n\n14   renewable energy. Under the statute’s plain language, an incentive will be provided\n\n15   to encourage a public utility “to produce or acquire renewable energy that exceeds\n\n16   the applicable annual [RPS]” or that accomplishes one of the other secondary\n\n17   objectives listed in the statute. See § 62-16-4(D) (providing an incentive “to produce\n\n18   or acquire renewable energy” that reduces carbon emissions earlier than required or\n\n19   that reduces the coal-fired generation of electricity).\n\n\n                                               15\n\f 1   {21}   Instead of offering an alternative construction of Section 62-16-4(D), SPS\n\n 2   argues that a literal interpretation “would lead to absurd results and thwart the\n\n 3   Legislature’s intent to incentivize utilities to exceed the RPS.” SPS points to two\n\n 4   other provisions to illustrate the purported absurdity that would result from a literal\n\n 5   reading of Section 62-16-4(D): (1) the Legislature’s finding that “a public utility\n\n 6   should have incentives to go beyond the minimum requirements of the [RPS],” § 62-\n\n 7   16-2(A)(5); and (2) the mandate that “[a] public utility shall meet the [RPS] . . . as\n\n 8   demonstrated by its retirement of [RECs],” § 62-16-4(A). Based on these provisions,\n\n 9   SPS insists that retiring RECs must be worthy of an incentive to exceed the RPS\n\n10   because retiring RECs is the only way to “establish compliance with the [RPS].”\n\n11   Section 62-16-5(A)(1); see also § 62-16-4(A). The SPS maintains that otherwise,\n\n12   “the Legislature chose to incentivize utilities to exceed the RPS but then failed to\n\n13   provide any mechanism for them to do so.”\n\n14   {22}   We will depart from a statute’s literal meaning when the statute is shown to\n\n15   be ambiguous by “one or more provisions giving rise to genuine uncertainty as to\n\n16   what the legislature was trying to accomplish.” State ex rel. Helman v. Gallegos,\n\n17   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1994-NMSC-023</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 23, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1366849\"><a href=\"/opinion/1366849/state-ex-rel-helman-v-gallegos/\">117 N.M. 346</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">871 P.2d 1352</span><pre class=\"inline\">. We see no “genuine\n\n18   uncertainty” about the purpose or meaning of Section 62-16-4(D) in relation to the\n\n19   statute’s plain language. To the contrary, providing an incentive to encourage a\n\n\n                                               16\n\f 1   public utility “to produce or acquire renewable energy” is entirely consistent with\n\n 2   the overarching purpose of Section 62-16-4, particularly after the 2019 amendments\n\n 3   to the REA.\n\n 4   {23}   As previously explained, Section 62-16-4(A) was amended in 2019 to\n\n 5   mandate that public utilities keep pace with a series of increasing RPS benchmarks\n\n 6   and make “[r]easonable and consistent progress” toward supplying one hundred\n\n 7   percent of all retail sales of electricity in New Mexico from zero carbon resources\n\n 8   by the year 2045. Section 62-16-4(A)(6). These demanding requirements signal a\n\n 9   clear legislative intent to reduce and eliminate from the electricity provided to New\n\n10   Mexico public utility customers the use of any electricity generation resources that\n\n11   emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Section 62-16-3(K) (defining a “zero\n\n12   carbon resource,” in part, as “an electricity generation resource that emits no carbon\n\n13   dioxide into the atmosphere” (emphasis added)). As a necessary corollary, these\n\n14   requirements also signal an intent to compel public utilities to procure sufficient zero\n\n15   carbon resources to meet the zero carbon resource standard by 2045. Against this\n\n16   backdrop, an incentive clearly acts as a carrot “to encourage” a public utility to\n\n17   increase its renewable energy portfolio and reduce carbon dioxide and other harmful\n\n18   emissions faster than the REA requires. See § 62-16-4(D). Conditioning an incentive\n\n19   on a proposal that will produce or acquire renewable energy ensures that a proposed\n\n\n                                               17\n\f 1   measure will not qualify for an incentive unless, at minimum, it advances a utility’s\n\n 2   progress toward achieving the zero carbon resource standard. Id. In short, the\n\n 3   statute’s purpose supports and does not undermine its literal meaning.\n\n 4   {24}   To read Section 62-16-4(D) as SPS suggests would elevate form over\n\n 5   substance. The act of retiring RECs alone does nothing to further the statute’s\n\n 6   objectives. SPS’s proposal for an incentive illustrates the point. SPS characterized\n\n 7   its proposal as a plan “to supply no less than 40% of [its] New Mexico retail energy\n\n 8   sales [from renewable energy] three years early.” But SPS’s supporting\n\n 9   documentation showed that in 2020, it actually generated and purchased renewable\n\n10   energy in an amount that was substantially equivalent to its RPS obligation—twenty\n\n11   percent of its retail electricity sales.11 Section 62-16-4(A)(2) (setting forth an RPS\n\n12   of twenty percent, effective January 1, 2020). SPS also admitted that it was not\n\n13   proposing to produce or acquire additional renewable energy or renewable energy\n\n14   resources. Rather, SPS proposed only to retire banked RECs from its sizeable\n\n15   balance of RECs carried forward from renewable energy generated in previous\n\n\n\n             SPS generated and purchased approximately 1.46 million MWh of\n            11\n\n     renewable energy in 2020, which exceeded its RPS compliance requirement by\n     approximately 4,910 MWh or 0.34%. Notably, at SPS’s proposed incentive rate of\n     $1 per MWh, its excess renewable energy for 2020 would have supported an\n     incentive of $4,911, far less than the $1.65 million incentive that it requested for\n     2022.\n\n                                              18\n\f 1   years. 12 SPS’s proposal thus would have done nothing to expand SPS’s renewable\n\n 2   energy portfolio or reduce carbon emissions during the three years that its requested\n\n 3   incentive would have been in effect. We see nothing in the REA to suggest that the\n\n 4   Legislature intended the award of an incentive under these circumstances. We\n\n 5   therefore find no ambiguity that would lead us to ignore the plain meaning of Section\n\n 6   62-16-4(D), and we affirm the PRC’s interpretation of the statute according to its\n\n 7   plain language.\n\n 8   2.     The availability of incentives under the REA since at least 2007 does not\n 9          require the award of an incentive in this case\n\n10   {25}   We are similarly unpersuaded by SPS’s argument that the availability of\n\n11   incentives under the REA since 2007 compels a different result. SPS offered\n\n12   testimony in support of its incentive application that “almost all renewable\n\n13   procurements on SPS’s system were constructed before 2019 with the knowledge\n\n14   that SPS could be eligible for an incentive under the Act.” This testimony reveals a\n\n15   basic misunderstanding of what the Legislature intended an incentive to accomplish.\n\n\n\n            12\n              SPS has represented throughout this proceeding that, unless it receives an\n     incentive to retire its banked RECs early, it has enough banked RECs to allow it to\n     continue meeting its RPS obligations without procuring new renewable resources\n     “until at least 2030.” And even if it receives an incentive to retire RECs early, SPS\n     estimates that it will remain compliant with its existing resources until some time\n     between 2026 and 2029.\n\n                                              19\n\f 1   {26}   Although the REA does not define the term incentive, common definitions\n\n 2   describe it as something that “incites,” “induces,” “motivates,” or “encourages” one\n\n 3   to take action. See, e.g., Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2020),\n\n 4   (defining “incentive” as “something that incites or has a tendency to incite to . . .\n\n 5   action”); New Oxford American Dictionary (3d ed. 2010) (defining “incentive” as\n\n 6   “a thing that motivates or encourages one to do something”); American Heritage\n\n 7   Dictionary (5th ed. 2011) (defining “incentive” as “[s]omething, such as the fear of\n\n 8   punishment or the expectation of reward, that induces action or motivates effort”).\n\n 9   These definitions align closely with the plain language of Section 62-16-4(D), which\n\n10   provides that the PRC shall award an incentive “to encourage public utilities to\n\n11   produce or acquire renewable energy.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n12   {27}   Given that one cannot encourage past behavior, the problem for SPS is simply\n\n13   a matter of timing. We agree that incentives have been available since at least 2007,\n\n14   and had SPS requested an incentive before it constructed the “renewable\n\n15   procurements” in question, it may well have qualified for an incentive to\n\n16   “encourage” the associated investments. Section 62-16-4(D); see also § 62-16-\n\n17   4(A)(4) (2007) (providing for an incentive to “encourage public utilities to acquire\n\n18   renewable energy supplies that exceed the applicable annual [RPS]”). But at this\n\n19   stage, SPS seeks a reward—not an incentive—for renewable resources or energy\n\n\n                                              20\n\f 1   that it already has produced or acquired beyond the REA’s demands. Section 62-16-\n\n 2   4(D) does not authorize the PRC to reward SPS’s past behavior. Having failed to\n\n 3   request an incentive before exceeding its obligations under the REA, SPS’s actions\n\n 4   vis-à-vis Section 62-16-4(D) were voluntary. Those actions do not support\n\n 5   additional compensation from SPS’s customers beyond the reasonable rate of return\n\n 6   that SPS already has earned through the ratemaking process for the electricity\n\n 7   associated with SPS’s banked RECs.\n\n 8   3.     Substantial evidence supports the PRC’s finding that SPS did not\n 9          propose to produce or acquire renewable energy to support its incentive\n10          request\n\n11   {28}   As a final point in our review of the denial of SPS’s incentive application, we\n\n12   address SPS’s argument that the PRC lacked substantial evidence to support the\n\n13   following finding:\n\n14          [T]he Commission concurs with the [Recommended Decision’s]\n15          finding that it was speculative that SPS’s early retirement of excess\n16          RECs would result in the early acquisition of resources to meet SPS’s\n17          RPS in the future because there was no evidence of any firm plans to\n18          acquire or produce any additional renewable energy and because future\n19          acquisitions or procurements would only meet its RPS for compliance\n20          purposes, not exceed its RPS for the purposes required by the financial\n21          incentive statute.\n\n22   SPS argues that the finding is unsupported because “SPS presented uncontroverted\n\n23   testimony that the proposed retirement of RECs to exceed the RPS in 2022 through\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f 1   2024 would accelerate SPS’s need to acquire additional resources by approximately\n\n 2   two to four years.”\n\n 3   {29}   “[W]e will affirm the Commission’s order if it is supported by substantial\n\n 4   evidence, which is evidence that is credible in light of the whole record and that is\n\n 5   sufficient for a reasonable mind to accept as adequate to support the conclusion\n\n 6   reached by the agency.” Citizens for Fair Rates &amp; the Env’t v.

We address SPS’s substantial-evidence challenge only to the\n\n 9   extent that it may implicate our conclusion that the PRC properly denied SPS’s\n\n10   incentive application under Section 62-16-4(D) because SPS “did not propose to\n\n11   ‘produce or acquire’ any renewable energy.” Our concern therefore is whether the\n\n12   PRC had substantial evidence to find that “there was no evidence of any firm plans\n\n13   to acquire or produce any additional renewable energy.”\n\n14   {30}   As we have previously noted, SPS admitted at the hearing on its application\n\n15   that its incentive proposal did not include a “specific plan” to produce or acquire any\n\n16   additional renewable energy or renewable energy resources. The “uncontroverted\n\n17   testimony” cited by SPS does not suggest otherwise. It merely explains that, based\n\n18   on SPS’s projections,\n\n19          if SPS continues to retire the minimal amount of RECs required to\n20          comply with the RPS, SPS is projecting compliance through 2030 to\n\n                                               22\n\f 1          beyond 2031 . . . . However, if SPS’s plan to meet the 40% requirement\n 2          three years early is approved, SPS is projecting compliance through\n 3          2026 and 2029. In other words, if SPS’s plan is approved, SPS would\n 4          be required to accelerate the acquisition of additional renewable\n 5          resources to maintain RPS compliance.\n\n 6   This testimony underscores the PRC’s finding that SPS did not actually propose to\n\n 7   produce or acquire renewable energy, let alone renewable energy that would exceed\n\n 8   the RPS as required for an incentive under Section 62-16-4(D); rather, SPS merely\n\n 9   offered projections about when it would need to acquire “additional renewable\n\n10   resources to maintain RPS compliance” after expiration of SPS’s incentive at the\n\n11   end of 2024. Based on our review, we hold that substantial evidence supports the\n\n12   PRC’s finding that SPS did not propose to produce or acquire renewable energy to\n\n13   support its request for an incentive.\n\n14   {31}   In sum, with no proposal to produce or acquire renewable energy that exceeds\n\n15   the RPS, the PRC’s denial of SPS’s incentive application under Section 62-16-4(D)\n\n16   was neither unreasonable nor unlawful. Because we affirm the denial under the\n\n17   statute, we need not reach SPS’s arguments that the PRC improperly denied the\n\n18   application under the various provisions of Rule 572.\n\n19   B.     The Amended Rule Is Not Unreasonable or Unlawful\n\n20   {32}   We turn now to SPS’s many challenges to the Amended Rule itself. SPS\n\n21   argues that various provisions of the Amended Rule exceed the scope of the REA,\n\n\n                                             23\n\f 1   are arbitrary and capricious and void for vagueness, and suffer from a litany of other\n\n 2   legal and procedural deficiencies. After the completion of briefing the PRC filed a\n\n 3   motion to dismiss as moot four of the issues raised by SPS in its appeal from the\n\n 4   order approving the Amended Rule. The PRC argued that its subsequent order filed\n\n 5   on December 7, 2022, which approved the Second Amended Rule after the instant\n\n6    appeals were filed, revised certain language in the Amended Rule that SPS had\n\n7    challenged in this appeal. We agree that three of SPS’s arguments are moot, and we\n\n8    address those issues at the end of our analysis. But first, we consider SPS’s\n\n9    arguments that are properly before us.\n\n10   {33}   SPS brings a facial challenge to the rule and therefore must establish that the\n\n11   rule is invalid in all of its applications, not merely “under some specific set of\n\n12   circumstances.” Gila Res.

The Amended Rule’s cost-benefit requirement does not exceed the scope\n 5          of the REA and is not otherwise unreasonable or unlawful\n\n 6   {34}   SPS first challenges the cost-benefit requirement set forth in the Amended\n\n 7   Rule, specifically Rule 572.22(D), which precludes the award of an incentive for a\n\n 8   “particular investment if the cost of that investment exceeds the demonstrable value\n\n 9   of the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions.” SPS argues\n\n10   that the provision (1) ignores the scope of REA-authorized incentives by limiting\n\n11   incentives to investments that result in a reduction in carbon dioxide or other\n\n12   emissions when Section 62-16-4(D) also allows incentives for measures that exceed\n\n13   the RPS or reduce the coal-fired generation of electricity; (2) exceeds the scope of\n\n14   the REA by requiring a cost-benefit analysis that is not required under the REA; (3)\n\n15   is void for vagueness and arbitrary and capricious; and (4) was adopted without\n\n16   notice and comment in violation of due process.\n\n17   a.     Rule 572.22(D) does not preclude an incentive for measures that would\n18          exceed the RPS or reduce coal-fired electricity-generation\n\n19   {35}   SPS argues that Rule 572.22(D) limits incentives “only to investments that\n\n20   result in a reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions” and effectively writes out\n\n\n                                               25\n\f 1   of existence the other two bases under Section 62-16-4(D) for earning an incentive,\n\n 2   namely, exceeding the RPS and reducing the coal-fired generation of electricity.13\n\n 3   This argument is overstated and does not withstand scrutiny.\n\n 4   {36}   Despite SPS’s repeated assertions to the contrary, Rule 572.22(D) does not\n\n 5   necessarily preclude an incentive for measures that would exceed the RPS or reduce\n\n 6   coal-fired generation. Like Section 62-16-4(D), Rule 572.22 expressly provides that\n\n 7   a utility may seek an incentive for implementing measures “to accomplish at least\n\n 8   one of the following purposes: (1) exceeding the public utility’s annual RPS\n\n 9   requirements; (2) reducing carbon dioxide emissions earlier than required by [the\n\n10   RPS]; or (3) reducing the generation of electricity by coal-fired generating\n\n11   facilities.” See 17.9.572.22(A), (B) NMAC (5/4/2021) (emphasis added). The cost-\n\n12   benefit requirement ensures that an investment proposed to accomplish any of these\n\n13   purposes—including exceeding the RPS or reducing the coal-fired generation of\n\n14   electricity—is cost-effective relative to “the demonstrable value of the\n\n15   corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions.” 17.9.572.22(D)\n\n16   NMAC (5/4/2021). That the metric for measuring cost-effectiveness overlaps with\n\n17   the purpose of reducing carbon emissions does not exclude an incentive for\n\n\n\n             The PRC argues that this issue is moot for largely semantic reasons, which\n            13\n\n     we decline to address because we are unpersuaded by SPS’s argument.\n\n                                             26\n\f 1   exceeding the RPS or reducing the coal-fired generation of electricity. Nor does the\n\n 2   metric guarantee an incentive for reducing carbon emissions alone. The cost-benefit\n\n 3   requirement applies equally to any of the purposes for earning an incentive.\n\n 4   {37}   As a fallback to its categorical argument, SPS argues that the cost-benefit\n\n 5   requirement “renders meaningless the provisions of the Rule that purport to allow\n\n 6   incentives for exceeding the RPS or reducing coal-fired generation.” (Emphasis\n\n 7   added.) To illustrate the point, SPS provides the single example of biomass\n\n 8   resources, which the Legislature included in the definition of a renewable energy\n\n 9   resource that can be used to meet and exceed the RPS. See § 62-16-3(H)(3)\n\n10   (providing that biomass resources under the REA are “limited to agriculture or\n\n11   animal waste, small diameter timber, not to exceed eight inches, salt cedar and other\n\n12   phreatophyte or woody vegetation removed from river basins or watersheds in New\n\n13   Mexico”). SPS argues that Rule 572.22(D) precludes a utility from using biomass\n\n14   resources to earn an incentive for exceeding the RPS because “biomass fuel results\n\n15   in substantial carbon emissions and the increased use of biomass fuel to generate\n\n16   electricity would likely not result in a decrease in carbon emissions.”\n\n17   {38}   This argument fails for at least two reasons. First, SPS’s assertions about the\n\n18   “likely” carbon-related effects of biomass resources are not supported by the record\n\n19   and thus are merely the arguments of counsel and not evidence. See, e.g., State v.\n\n\n                                              27\n\f </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1   Hall, 2013</span><pre class=\"inline\">-NMSC-001, ¶ 28, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">294 P.3d 1235</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“It is not our practice to rely on\n\n 2   assertions of counsel unaccompanied by support in the record.” (internal quotation\n\n 3   marks and citation omitted)). Second, SPS’s assertions are contradicted by the REA\n\n 4   itself, which has provided since 2019 that REC-eligible biomass resources must\n\n 5   come from a facility certified to “have zero life cycle carbon emissions.” Section 62-\n\n 6   16-3(H)(3)(b). This lone example therefore does not establish that Rule 572.22(D)’s\n\n 7   cost-benefit requirement precludes an incentive for exceeding the RPS, even when\n\n 8   using biomass resources to do so. To the contrary, any measure that otherwise\n\n 9   qualifies for an incentive can satisfy Rule 572.22(D)—as long as the cost would be\n\n10   less than the value of the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other\n\n11   emissions. 14 We thus disagree that Rule 572.22(D) exceeds the scope of the REA by\n\n12   limiting incentives only to investments that would result in a reduction of carbon\n\n13   dioxide or other emissions.\n\n\n\n           14\n              We also note that, although this is a facial challenge, SPS’s evidence to\n     support its own incentive request similarly failed to show that Rule 572.22(D)\n     precludes the award of an incentive for SPS’s proposal for an incentive. Although\n     SPS admitted that the cost of retiring extra RECs would be greater than the value of\n     the corresponding reduction in carbon dioxide or other emissions, it also volunteered\n     that it had declined to use a different methodology that “could have generated a\n     better result for the cost-benefit analysis required by the rule.” Thus, SPS’s own\n     evidence was inconclusive about whether Rule 572.22(D) “renders meaningless the\n     provisions of the REA that allow incentives for exceeding the RPS.”\n\n                                              28\n\f 1   b.     Rule 572.22(D) is a reasonable exercise of the PRC’s overarching duties\n 2          under the Public Utility Act\n\n 3   {39}   SPS next argues that Rule 572.22(D) exceeds the scope of the REA by\n\n 4   requiring a cost-benefit analysis that is not explicitly required by statute. SPS argues\n\n 5   that, because the REA expressly includes a cost-benefit analysis for measures taken\n\n 6   to meet the 2040 and 2045 RPS levels of eighty percent and one hundred percent,\n\n 7   the exclusion of such an analysis for complying with earlier RPS requirements was\n\n 8   purposeful, such that Rule 572.22(D) is contrary to legislative intent. See § 62-16-\n\n 9   4(B)(3) (“In administering the [eighty percent and one hundred percent RPS\n\n10   standards], the commission shall . . . prevent unreasonable impacts to customer\n\n11   electricity bills, taking into consideration the economic and environmental costs and\n\n12   benefits of renewable energy resources and zero carbon resources . . . .”).\n\n13   {40}   We are not persuaded. This argument fails to consider Rule 572.22(D) in the\n\n14   context of both the REA and the PRC’s broader regulatory duties. Cf. Baker v.\n\n15   Hedstrom, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1039966\"><a href=\"/opinion/1039966/baker-v-hedstrom/\">2013-NMSC-043</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 15, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">309 P.3d 1047</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“We must examine [the\n\n16   plaintiffs’] interpretation in the context of the statute as a whole, including the\n\n17   purposes and consequences of the . . .

However, the REA provides minimal guidance for determining whether a\n\n 3   requested incentive may be justified, leaving the PRC to apply its broad policy-\n\n 4   making authority and expertise to fill in the legislative gaps to effectuate the\n\n 5   purposes of the REA. See, e.g., New Energy Econ., Inc. v. N.M. Pub Reg. Comm’n,\n\n 6   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018-NMSC-024</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 25, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">416 P.3d 277</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“[I]f it is clear that our Legislature delegated\n\n 7   to the PRC (either explicitly or implicitly) the task of giving meaning to interpretive\n\n 8   gaps in a statute, we will defer to the PRC’s construction of the statute as the PRC\n\n 9   has been delegated policy-making authority and possesses the expertise necessary to\n\n10   make sound policy.”). Under these circumstances, the PRC necessarily falls back on\n\n11   its overarching duty to regulate public utilities in a manner that balances the interests\n\n12   of the public, consumers, and investors to ensure “that reasonable and proper\n\n13   services shall be available at fair, just and reasonable rates.” NMSA 1978, § 62-3-1\n\n14   (B) (2008); see also NMSA 1978, § 62-8-1 (1941) (“Every rate made, demanded or\n\n15   received by any public utility shall be just and reasonable.”); cf. § 62-16-2(A)(4)\n\n16   (“[P]ublic utilities should be able to recover their reasonable costs incurred to\n\n17   procure or generate energy from renewable energy resources . . . .”).\n\n18   {41}   Against this backdrop, Rule 572.22 first ensures that any incentive awarded\n\n19   under the REA will comply with the statute by encouraging a utility to produce or\n\n\n                                                30\n\f 1   acquire renewable energy that accomplishes one or more of the REA’s statutory\n\n 2   bases for an incentive. See 17.9.572.22(A), (B) NMAC (5/4/2021); see also § 62-\n\n 3   16-4(D). The utility then must demonstrate “that the terms and duration of the\n\n 4   proposed incentive . . . are just and reasonable in light of the utility’s costs, its\n\n 5   authorized return, and the magnitude of any other incentives that have been\n\n 6   authorized by the commission.” 17.9.572.22(C) NMAC (5/4/2021). The utility also\n\n 7   must show that the measure proposed to support the incentive will be a cost-effective\n\n8    investment as compared with the “value of the corresponding reduction in carbon\n\n9    dioxide or other emissions.” 17.9.572.22(D) NMAC (5/4/2021).\n\n10   {42}   This framework implements the REA’s incentive and rulemaking\n\n11   requirements in a manner that comports with the PRC’s broad mandate to regulate\n\n12   public utilities to ensure “that reasonable and proper services shall be available at\n\n13   fair, just and reasonable rates.” Section 62-3-1(B). Given that an incentive will\n\n14   compensate a utility at the expense of ratepayers, we hold that the PRC acted within\n\n15   its authority by requiring an incentive to be just and reasonable and based on a cost-\n\n16   effective investment.

Rather, the PRC has\n\n 3   adopted a rule that implements the REA’s incentive provision, consistent with the\n\n 4   PRC’s traditional exercise of its regulatory authority. Sandel is thus inapposite.\n\n 5   {44}   In sum, the PRC must carry out its duty to establish just and reasonable rates\n\n 6   absent a clear statement to the contrary. See, e.g., Hobbs Gas Co. v.

That\n\n14   mandate is broad enough to encompass a cost-benefit requirement that precludes the\n\n15   award of an incentive unless the utility demonstrates a benefit to ratepayers that\n\n16   ensures progress toward the zero carbon resource standard.\n\n17   c.     SPS’s remaining challenges to Rule 572.22(D) fail\n\n18   {45}   SPS’s two remaining challenges to Rule 572.22(D) also fail. First, SPS argues\n\n19   that the cost-benefit provision in Rule 572.22(D) was adopted without notice and\n\n\n                                               33\n\f 1   comment, in violation of due process. We readily dispense with this argument. The\n\n 2   PRC’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking included a draft of proposed Rule 572.22\n\n 3   that “request[ed] that all comments include a proposal on how best to calculate a\n\n 4   financial incentive.” SPS proposed a method of calculating a financial incentive that\n\n 5   the PRC ultimately declined to adopt. Instead, the PRC adopted the cost-benefit\n\n 6   requirement that was proposed by Occidental Permian Limited, Ltd. (Occidental) in\n\n 7   its initial comment to the proposed rule. Significantly, SPS submitted a written\n\n 8   comment on Occidental’s proposed requirement, stating that it “is an ambiguous,\n\n 9   arbitrary, and capricious limitation found nowhere in the statute.” SPS thus had\n\n10   notice that the PRC was considering a method of calculating a financial incentive,\n\n11   had an opportunity to propose its own method, and had an opportunity to comment\n\n12   on the very language that the PRC eventually adopted. Under these circumstances,\n\n13   SPS’s claimed due process violation rings hollow. See, e.g., Rivas v. Bd. of\n\n14   Cosmetologists, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1984-NMSC-076</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 9, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">101 N.M. 592</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">686 P.2d 934</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“Case law\n\n15   suggests that the minimum protections upon which administrative action may be\n\n16   based, [are] according to interested parties a simple notice and right to comment.”\n\n17   (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n18   {46}   Second, SPS argues that Rule 572.22(D) provisions for calculating the costs\n\n19   and benefits supporting an incentive application are void for vagueness. In\n\n\n                                               34\n\f 1   particular, SPS challenges the requirement to provide “the cost of the measures\n\n 2   implemented by the utility that resulted in the lower carbon dioxide emissions.”\n\n 3   17.9.572.22(D)(4) NMAC (5/4/2021). SPS similarly challenges the requirement to\n\n 4   provide “the estimated value of the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions . . . based\n\n 5   on an analysis of relevant carbon dioxide markets.” 17.9.572.22(D)(3) NMAC\n\n 6   (5/4/2021). SPS argues that, without greater specificity, the rule “requires utilities to\n\n 7   guess at its meaning and is impermissibly vague.” We disagree. “A court\n\n 8   entertaining a pre-enforcement challenge to a regulation that does not implicate\n\n 9   constitutionally protected conduct such as the First Amendment right to freedom of\n\n10   expression may sustain a vagueness challenge only if the law ‘is impermissibly\n\n11   vague in all of its applications.’” N.M.

SPS’s ability to comprehend the rule’s requirements undermines its\n\n17   argument that the rule “is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\f 1   2.     SPS’s void-for-vagueness challenges lack merit\n\n 2   {47}   Continuing with the void-for-vagueness theme, SPS challenges three other\n\n 3   provisions of Rule 572 on vagueness grounds. First, SPS argues that the rule’s\n\n 4   definition of the term “financial incentive” is unconstitutionally vague. See\n\n 5   17.9.572.7(F) NMAC (5/4/2021). SPS maintains that the definition’s use of the\n\n 6   terms “capital investment opportunities,” “certain behaviors or actions,” and “would\n\n 7   not otherwise have occurred” are confusing, ambiguous, and require utilities to guess\n\n 8   at their meanings. Second, SPS argues that the definition of “procure” and\n\n 9   “procurement” is ambiguous “to the extent it does not comport with the Amended\n\n10   Rule’s actual use of the term ‘procurement.’” See 17.9.572.7(P)(4) NMAC\n\n11   (5/4/2021). SPS argues that the Amended Rule “defines procurement to mean a\n\n12   bidding process, but the rule subsequently uses the term to refer to the cost of the\n\n13   generation purchased rather than the bidding process itself” and then cites, as an\n\n14   example, “17.9.572.12(C) NMAC (5/4/2021) (‘To the extent a procurement is\n\n15   greater than the reasonable cost threshold and results in excess costs . . . .’).” SPS\n\n16   argues that the actual use of the term procurement relative to the definition provided\n\n17   in the rule is “inconsistent and confusing” and “renders the definition vague and\n\n18   unenforceable.” Third, SPS challenges the provision that requires a public utility to\n\n19   give a preference to renewable energy generated in New Mexico in limited\n\n\n                                              36\n\f 1   circumstances. See 17.9.572.10(A) NMAC (5/4/2021) (“Other factors being equal,\n\n 2   preference shall be given to renewable energy generated in New Mexico.”). SPS\n\n 3   argues that the requirement for a preference when “[o]ther factors [are] equal” fails\n\n 4   to identify what those factors may be and as such, the provision requires utilities to\n\n 5   guess at its meaning and is impermissibly vague. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n 6   {48}   Although these provisions have not been drafted with perfect clarity, they are\n\n 7   sufficient for due process purposes.

We are\n\n17   thus unpersuaded that the challenged provisions are “impermissibly vague in all of\n\n18   [their] applications.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n\n                                               37\n\f 1   3.     The Amended Rule’s preference for renewable energy generated in New\n 2          Mexico is not unlawful\n\n 3   {49}   SPS challenges the Amended Rule’s preference for renewable energy\n\n 4   generated in New Mexico, 17.9.572.10(A) NMAC (5/4/2021), as (1) exceeding the\n\n 5   scope of the REA, (2) unlawfully discriminating against citizens of other states in\n\n 6   violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const, art. IV, § 2, cl. 1, and\n\n 7   (3) violating the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.\n\n 8   {50}   As for exceeding the scope of the REA, we reiterate that the PRC is not\n\n 9   precluded from exceeding the REA’s requirements on matters of public policy\n\n10   specifically entrusted to the PRC’s discretion and expertise. See New Energy Econ.,\n\n11   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018-NMSC-024</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 25. The REA directs the PRC to promulgate rules to implement\n\n12   the Act and its objectives, § 62-16-9, including rules to implement the legislative\n\n13   finding that “the use of renewable energy by public utilities subject to commission\n\n14   oversight in accordance with the [REA] can bring significant economic benefits to\n\n15   New Mexico,” § 62-16-2(A)(2). Stating, in 17.9.572.10(A) NMAC (5/4/2021), a\n\n16   narrow preference for renewable energy generated in New Mexico—in the unlikely\n\n17   circumstance of “[o]ther factors being equal”—is a reasonable exercise of the PRC’s\n\n18   mandate to implement the Act in a manner that is economically beneficial to New\n\n19   Mexico when lawful and appropriate.\n\n\n\n                                               38\n\f 1   {51}   Turning to SPS’s unlawful discrimination argument, we note that this\n\n 2   argument is largely undeveloped and is not supported by SPS’s lone citation of\n\n 3   United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Mayor &amp; Council of City of\n\n 4   Camden, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">465 U.S. 208</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). Unlike the requirement in United Building that at\n\n 5   least forty percent of the employees of city contractors and subcontractors must be\n\n 6   local residents, see id. at 210, the Amended Rule’s preference does not require any\n\n 7   of a utility’s renewable energy to be generated in New Mexico. “Other factors being\n\n 8   equal,” 17.9.572.10(A) NMAC (5/4/2021), the preference merely acts as a tie-\n\n 9   breaker. SPS cites no authority that such a tie-breaker amounts to unlawful\n\n10   discrimination against the citizens of other states under the Privileges and\n\n11   Immunities Clause, and we therefore assume that none exists. See Lee v. Lee (In re\n\n12   Doe), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1984-NMSC-024</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 2, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">100 N.M. 764</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">676 P.2d 1329</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“We assume where\n\n13   arguments in briefs are unsupported by cited authority, counsel after diligent search,\n\n14   was unable to find any supporting authority.”).\n\n15   {52}   That the challenged preference is a mere tie-breaker also distinguishes it from\n\n16   the cases cited by SPS in support of its similarly undeveloped argument under the\n\n17   dormant Commerce Clause.

Unlike the statutes in those cases, the Amended Rule’s\n\n 8   preference neither discriminates against interstate commerce nor imposes a burden\n\n 9   on such commerce that “is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local\n\n10   benefits.” See Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\">397 U.S. 137</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 142 (1970). Again, SPS\n\n11   cites no authority that a mere tie-breaker discriminates against or unlawfully burdens\n\n12   interstate commerce. Assuming no such authority exists, we conclude that the\n\n13   Amended Rule’s preference is not unreasonable or unlawful. See In re Doe, 1984-\n\n14   NMSC-024, ¶ 2.\n\n15   4.     Rule 572.22(E) does not exceed the scope of the REA by including a cost\n16          cap on incentives\n\n17   {53}   SPS argues that the Amended Rule’s cost cap on incentives exceeds the scope\n\n18   of the REA. Specifically, SPS challenges Rule 572.22(E), which provides, “The total\n\n19   financial incentive authorized for recovery in rates pursuant to this section shall not\n\n20   exceed the product (expressed in dollars) of: (1) the utility’s annual weighted\n\n                                               40\n\f 1   average cost of capital (expressed as a percent)[] and (2) the cost of the measures\n\n 2   described in Subsection B of this section.” 17.9.572.22(E) NMAC (5/4/2021). SPS\n\n 3   argues that this cap unduly limits the availability of incentives beyond the lone cost\n\n 4   cap actually established in the statute, which “protect[s] public utilities and their\n\n 5   ratepayers from renewable energy costs that are above a reasonable cost threshold.”\n\n 6   Section 62-16-2(B)(3); see also § 62-16-3(E) (establishing a reasonable cost\n\n 7   threshold of $60 per megawatt-hour of renewable energy with adjustments for\n\n 8   inflation after 2020).\n\n 9   {54}   As an initial matter, we note that the challenged provision does not establish\n\n10   a cap at all; rather, it ensures that any incentive is cost-based and justly and\n\n11   reasonably related to a utility’s approved weighted average percentage cost of\n\n12   capital. See, e.g., N.M. Att’y Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2011-NMSC-034</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 18 (holding that the adoption\n\n13   of rates was “arbitrary and unlawful in that they were not evidence-based, cost-\n\n14   based, nor utility specific”). We further note that SPS proposed an arbitrary incentive\n\n15   cap of $10 million in its initial comments to the proposed rule as part of its proposed\n\n16   method of calculating a financial incentive. SPS never withdrew its proposed cap or\n\n17   otherwise alerted the PRC to the argument that it raises on appeal. We therefore\n\n18   decline to address this argument further.\n\n19   5.     Rule 572.11 does not unreasonably or unlawfully restrict the application\n20          of the REA\n\n                                                 41\n\f 1   {55}   SPS next challenges the PRC’s adoption of Rule 572.11 as unreasonable and\n\n 2   unlawful. Rule 572.11 codifies one of the seven requirements set forth in Section\n\n 3   62-16-4(B) that govern how the PRC shall administer the eighty percent and one\n\n 4   hundred percent RPS requirements. Specifically, Rule 572.11 codifies the\n\n 5   requirement that the PRC shall, “in consultation with the department of environment,\n\n 6   ensure that the standard does not result in material increases to greenhouse gas\n\n 7   emissions from entities not subject to commission oversight and regulation.” Section\n\n 8   62-16-4(B)(6); see 17.9.572.11 NMAC (5/4/2021) (“After consultation with the\n\n 9   department of environment, the commission may not approve a public utility’s\n\n10   annual [REA] plan that result[s] in material increases to greenhouse gas emissions\n\n11   from entities not subject to commission oversight and regulation.”). SPS argues that,\n\n12   because the PRC did not codify the other six requirements set forth in the statute, the\n\n13   Amended Rule “selectively implement[s] the REA” and “limit[s] the application of\n\n14   [the REA] through the adoption of a regulation.” Intervenors, in their Joint Answer\n\n15   Brief, agree that the PRC’s “unexplained inclusion of one consideration in Section\n\n16   62-16-4(B) and exclusion of the remainder is unreasonable and should be annulled\n\n17   and vacated.”\n\n18   {56}   We disagree with the position of SPS and Intervenors that the PRC’s inclusion\n\n19   of only one of the requirements set forth in Section 62-16-4(B) requires annulling\n\n\n                                               42\n\f 1   and vacating the order approving the Amended Rule. Neither SPS nor Intervenors\n\n 2   cite authority requiring the PRC to take an all-or-nothing approach to codifying\n\n 3   multiple requirements set forth in a single, relevant statute. We therefore assume that\n\n 4   no such authority exists. See In re Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1984-NMSC-024</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 2 (“Issues raised in\n\n 5   appellate briefs which are unsupported by cited authority will not be reviewed by us\n\n 6   on appeal.”). Moreover, the Amended Rule’s language does not contradict or\n\n 7   otherwise conflict with the substantially identical language in the statute and does\n\n 8   not relieve the PRC from the remainder of its duties under the statute. Cf. NMSA\n\n 9   1978, § 14-4-5.7(A) (2017) (“A conflict between a rule and a statute is resolved in\n\n10   favor of the statute.”).\n\n11   6.     The PRC did not act unreasonably or unlawfully by “adopting the\n12          Amended Rule after it bifurcated critical matters from the rulemaking”\n\n13   {57}   SPS argues that the PRC acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it “bifurcated\n\n14   critical matters from the rulemaking” and it “transfer[ed] controversial issues to a\n\n15   separate rulemaking and subject[ed] utilities to a confusing, ambiguous, and vague\n\n16   rule.” Specifically, SPS contends that the PRC lacked authority to adopt the\n\n17   Amended Rule without addressing (1) the definition of the phrase “capital\n\n18   investment opportunities” in the definition of financial incentive, (2) whether a\n\n19   financial incentive would be available to advance the closure of the four corners\n\n20   nuclear facility, (3) whether the one hundred percent zero carbon standard includes\n\n                                               43\n\f 1   the 2040 RPS standard of eighty percent renewables and limits nuclear to twenty\n\n 2   percent, (4) whether Arizona Public Service could apply for a financial incentive as\n\n3    a nonregulated entity for the four corners nuclear facility, and (5) how the “average\n\n4    annual levelized cost” of energy should be calculated for purposes of the reasonable\n\n5    cost threshold definition set forth in Section 62-16-3(E).\n\n 6   {58}   The lone authority that SPS cites in support of this argument is a federal\n\n 7   district court case that granted a preliminary injunction against the implementation\n\n 8   of a rule that was adopted through a “staggered rulemaking” process. See Centro\n\n 9   Legal de la Raza v. Exec. Off. for Immigr. Rev., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">524 F. Supp. 3d 919</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 954-55 (N.D.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">10   Cal. 2021</span><pre class=\"inline\">). The circumstances of Centro Legal de la Raza are clearly\n\n11   distinguishable. In particular, the rulemaking in this case and the subsequent\n\n12   rulemaking that resulted in the Second Amended Rule were held in a sequential,\n\n13   orderly manner with full public notice of both proceedings and ample opportunity\n\n14   for public participation. Contra id. at 958 (holding that the agency’s rushed and\n\n15   overlapping rulemakings and decisions “deprived the public of the opportunity to\n\n16   consider how these rules intersected and impacted the Rule, and also raise[d] serious\n\n17   questions about whether the agency meaningfully addressed the interaction of these\n\n18   rules.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). SPS’s contention does not\n\n19   withstand scrutiny.\n\n\n                                              44\n\f 1   7.     SPS’s remaining arguments are moot\n\n2    a.     A reasonable cost threshold analysis is not required for existing\n3           procurements\n\n 4   {59}   SPS challenges the provision of the Amended Rule that implemented the\n\n 5   REA’s “reasonable cost threshold” (RCT) of sixty dollars per megawatt-hour that\n\n 6   was established by the Legislature in 2019. See § 62-16-4(E) (providing that a\n\n 7   “public utility shall not be required to incur” costs above the RCT to procure or\n\n 8   generate renewable energy to comply with the RPS); § 62-16-3(E) (defining\n\n 9   “reasonable cost threshold”). SPS argues that the Amended Rule’s requirement to\n\n10   include an RCT analysis for existing renewable energy procurements applies the\n\n11   RCT retroactively and is therefore unlawful. See 17.9.572.12(B) NMAC (5/4/2021)\n\n12   (providing that a public utility “shall include in its annual [REA] plan [an RCT]\n\n13   analysis by procurement, existing or proposed, for the plan year” (emphasis added));\n\n14   see also, e.g., Howell v. Heim, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1994-NMSC-103</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 17, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1297020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1297020/howell-v-heim/\">118 N.M. 500</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">882 P.2d 541</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n15   (“New Mexico law presumes that statutes and rules apply prospectively absent a\n\n16   clear intention to the contrary.”). However, the Second Amended Rule removed the\n\n17   reference to “existing” procurements and now requires an RCT analysis only for\n\n18   “proposed” procurements. Compare 17.9.572.12(A) NMAC (2/28/2023) with\n\n19   17.9.572.12(B) NMAC (5/4/2021). And as we have already determined, the PRC\n\n20   denied SPS’s incentive application under Section 62-16-4(D) and did not rely on\n\n                                             45\n\f 1   Rule 572.12(B). A ruling on this issue therefore would not “grant actual relief,” and\n\n 2   accordingly the issue is moot. Gunaji v.

The typographical error in Rule 572.12(C) has been corrected\n\n 8   {60}   SPS argues that the order approving the Amended Rule must be vacated and\n\n 9   annulled because of a typographical error in the Amended Rule that “states the exact\n\n10   opposite of the REA.” Compare § 62-16-4(E) (“The provisions of this subsection do\n\n11   not preclude a public utility from accepting a project with a cost that would exceed\n\n12   the [RCT].” (emphasis added)) with 17.9.572.12(C) NMAC (5/4/2021) (“The\n\n13   provisions of this rule do preclude a public utility from accepting a project with a\n\n14   cost that would exceed the [RCT].” (emphasis added)). However, the Second\n\n15   Amended Rule corrected the error such that the current rule is now consistent with\n\n16   the statute. See 17.9.572.12(B) NMAC (2/28/2023). Nonetheless, SPS continues to\n\n17   press the issue because the PRC denied SPS’s incentive application based on the\n\n18   “flawed rule.” We disagree. The PRC reasonably and lawfully denied SPS’s\n\n19   incentive application irrespective of the Amended Rule’s “flawed” RCT provision,\n\n\n                                              46\n\f 1   which has now been corrected. This issue is therefore moot. See Gunaji, 2001-\n\n 2   NMSC-028, ¶ 9; KOB-TV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2005-NMCA-049</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 37.\n\n 3   c.     No controversy exists about whether the Amended Rule requires a new\n 4          competitive selection process for existing resources\n\n 5   {61}   SPS challenges the Amended Rule’s provision implementing a new\n\n 6   competitive bidding requirement established by the 2019 amendments to the REA\n\n 7   that applies to procurements for “new renewable energy” beginning on July 1, 2020.\n\n 8   See 17.9.572.13 NMAC (5/4/2021); see also § 62-16-4(G)(1), (3). SPS argues, “To\n\n 9   the extent the rule allows for application of the competitive procurement requirement\n\n10   to existing, previously approved resources, it is inconsistent with the REA.”\n\n11   (Emphasis added.) The PRC agrees that the competitive procurement requirement\n\n12   does not apply to “previously approved procurements” and maintains that neither\n\n13   the Amended Rule nor the Second Amended Rule provides otherwise. See\n\n14   17.9.572.13 NMAC (5/4/2021 &amp; 2/28/2023). We see no actual controversy on this\n\n15   issue. We agree with the parties that Section 62-16-4(F) and (G) impose distinct and\n\n16   different requirements on renewable-energy procurements proposed before and after\n\n17   July 1, 2020—with only the latter subject to a competitive procurement process. The\n\n18   Amended Rule does not provide to the contrary and does not require us to disturb\n\n19   the order adopting the Amended Rule. See, e.g., Tenneco Oil Co. v. N.M.
