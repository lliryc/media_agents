Trump, who seeks the Presidential\nnomination of the Republican Party in this year\u2019s election,\nfrom becoming President again. The Colorado Supreme\nCourt agreed with that contention. It ordered the Colorado\nsecretary of state to exclude the former President from the\nRepublican primary ballot in the State and to disregard any\nwrite-in votes that Colorado voters might cast for him.\n  Former President Trump challenges that decision on sev-\neral grounds. Because the Constitution makes Congress,\nrather than the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3\nagainst federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse.\n                             I\n  Last September, about six months before the March 5,\n2024, Colorado primary election, four Republican and two\nunaffiliated Colorado voters filed a petition against former\nPresident Trump and Colorado Secretary of State Jena\nGriswold in Colorado state court. These voters\u2014whom we\nrefer to as the respondents\u2014contend that after former\n\f2                   TRUMP v. ANDERSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 Presidential election,\nhe disrupted the peaceful transfer of power by intentionally\norganizing and inciting the crowd that breached the Capitol\nas Congress met to certify the election results on January\n6, 2021. One consequence of those actions, the respondents\nmaintain, is that former President Trump is constitution-\nally ineligible to serve as President again.\n   Their theory turns on Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. Section 3 provides:\n    \u201cNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Con-\n    gress, or elector of President and Vice President, or\n    hold any office, civil or military, under the United\n    States, or under any State, who, having previously\n    taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer\n    of the United States, or as a member of any State leg-\n    islature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any\n    State, to support the Constitution of the United States,\n    shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against\n    the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies\n    thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of\n    each House, remove such disability.\u201d\n   According to the respondents, Section 3 applies to the for-\nmer President because after taking the Presidential oath in\n2017, he intentionally incited the breaching of the Capitol\non January 6 in order to retain power. They claim that he\nis therefore not a qualified candidate, and that as a result,\nthe Colorado secretary of state may not place him on the\nprimary ballot. See Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a71\u20131\u2013113(1), 1\u20134\u2013\n1101(1), 1\u20134\u20131201, 1\u20134\u20131203(2)(a), 1\u20134\u20131204 (2023).\n   After a five-day trial, the state District Court found that\nformer President Trump had \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 3, but nonetheless denied the\nrespondents\u2019 petition. The court held that Section 3 did not\napply because the Presidency, which Section 3 does not\nmention by name, is not an \u201coffice . . . under the United\n\f                  Cite as: 601 U.

See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 184a\u2013284a.\n   In December, the Colorado Supreme Court reversed in\npart and affirmed in part by a 4 to 3 vote. Reversing the\nDistrict Court\u2019s operative holding, the majority concluded\nthat for purposes of Section 3, the Presidency is an office\nunder the United States and the President is an officer of\nthe United States. The court otherwise affirmed, holding\n(1) that the Colorado Election Code permitted the respond-\nents\u2019 challenge based on Section 3; (2) that Congress need\nnot pass implementing legislation for disqualifications un-\nder Section 3 to attach; (3) that the political question doc-\ntrine did not preclude judicial review of former President\nTrump\u2019s eligibility; (4) that the District Court did not abuse\nits discretion in admitting into evidence portions of a con-\ngressional Report on the events of January 6; (5) that the\nDistrict Court did not err in concluding that those events\nconstituted an \u201cinsurrection\u201d and that former President\nTrump \u201cengaged in\u201d that insurrection; and (6) that former\nPresident Trump\u2019s speech to the crowd that breached the\nCapitol on January 6 was not protected by the First Amend-\nment. See id., at 1a\u2013114a.\n   The Colorado Supreme Court accordingly ordered Secre-\ntary Griswold not to \u201clist President Trump\u2019s name on the\n2024 presidential primary ballot\u201d or \u201ccount any write-in\nvotes cast for him.\u201d Id., at 114a. Chief Justice Boatright\nand Justices Samour and Berkenkotter each filed dissent-\ning opinions. Id., at 115a\u2013124a, 125a\u2013161a, 162a\u2013183a.\n   Under the terms of the opinion of the Colorado Supreme\nCourt, its ruling was automatically stayed pending this\nCourt\u2019s review. See id., at 114a. We granted former Presi-\ndent Trump\u2019s petition for certiorari, which raised a single\nquestion: \u201cDid the Colorado Supreme Court err in ordering\nPresident Trump excluded from the 2024 presidential pri-\nmary ballot?\u201d See 601 U. S. ___ (2024). Concluding that it\n\f4                   TRUMP v. ANDERSON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ndid, we now reverse.\n                              II\n                              A\n   Proposed by Congress in 1866 and ratified by the States\nin 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cexpand[ed] federal\npower at the expense of state autonomy\u201d and thus \u201cfunda-\nmentally altered the balance of state and federal power\nstruck by the Constitution.\u201d Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Flor-\nida, 517 U. S. 44, 59 (1996); see also Ex parte Virginia, 100\nU. S. 339, 345 (1880). Section 1 of the Amendment, for in-\nstance, bars the States from \u201cdepriv[ing] any person of life,\nliberty, or property, without due process of law\u201d or\n\u201cdeny[ing] to any person . . . the equal protection of the\nlaws.\u201d And Section 5 confers on Congress \u201cpower to enforce\u201d\nthose prohibitions, along with the other provisions of the\nAmendment, \u201cby appropriate legislation.\u201d\n   Section 3 of the Amendment likewise restricts state au-\ntonomy, but through different means. It was designed to\nhelp ensure an enduring Union by preventing former Con-\nfederates from returning to power in the aftermath of the\nCivil War. See, e.g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,\n2544 (1866) (statement of Rep. Stevens, warning that with-\nout appropriate constitutional reforms \u201cyelling secession-\nists and hissing copperheads\u201d would take seats in the\nHouse); id., at 2768 (statement of Sen. Howard, lamenting\nprospect of a \u201cState Legislature . . . made up entirely of dis-\nloyal elements\u201d absent a disqualification provision). Sec-\ntion 3 aimed to prevent such a resurgence by barring from\noffice \u201cthose who, having once taken an oath to support the\nConstitution of the United States, afterward went into re-\nbellion against the Government of the United States.\u201d\nCong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st Sess., 626 (1869) (statement of\nSen. Trumbull).\n   Section 3 works by imposing on certain individuals a pre-\nventive and severe penalty\u2014disqualification from holding\n\f                  Cite as: 601 U.

It is therefore necessary, as Chief Justice Chase con-\ncluded and the Colorado Supreme Court itself recognized,\nto \u201c \u2018ascertain[ ] what particular individuals are embraced\u2019 \u201d\nby the provision. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a (quoting Grif-\nfin\u2019s Case, 11 F. Cas. 7, 26 (No. 5,815) (CC Va. 1869) (Chase,\nCircuit Justice)). Chase went on to explain that \u201c[t]o accom-\nplish this ascertainment and ensure effective results, pro-\nceedings, evidence, decisions, and enforcements of deci-\nsions, more or less formal, are indispensable.\u201d Id., at 26.\nFor its part, the Colorado Supreme Court also concluded\nthat there must be some kind of \u201cdetermination\u201d that Sec-\ntion 3 applies to a particular person \u201cbefore the disqualifi-\ncation holds meaning.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a.\n   The Constitution empowers Congress to prescribe how\nthose determinations should be made. The relevant provi-\nsion is Section 5, which enables Congress, subject of course\nto judicial review, to pass \u201cappropriate legislation\u201d to \u201cen-\nforce\u201d the Fourteenth Amendment. See City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U. S. 507, 536 (1997). Or as Senator Howard\nput it at the time the Amendment was framed, Section 5\n\u201ccasts upon Congress the responsibility of seeing to it, for\nthe future, that all the sections of the amendment are car-\nried out in good faith.\u201d Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,\nat 2768.\n   Congress\u2019s Section 5 power is critical when it comes to\nSection 3. Indeed, during a debate on enforcement legisla-\ntion less than a year after ratification, Sen. Trumbull noted\nthat \u201cnotwithstanding [Section 3] . . . hundreds of men\n[were] holding office\u201d in violation of its terms. Cong. Globe,\n41st Cong., 1st Sess., at 626. The Constitution, Trumbull\nnoted, \u201cprovide[d] no means for enforcing\u201d the disqualifica-\ntion, necessitating a \u201cbill to give effect to the fundamental\nlaw embraced in the Constitution.\u201d Ibid. The enforcement\nmechanism Trumbull championed was later enacted as\npart of the Enforcement Act of 1870, \u201cpursuant to the power\n\f6                   TRUMP v. ANDERSON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nconferred by \u00a75 of the [Fourteenth] Amendment.\u201d General\nBuilding Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S.\n375, 385 (1982); see 16 Stat. 143\u2013144.\n                                B\n    This case raises the question whether the States, in addi-\ntion to Congress, may also enforce Section 3. We conclude\nthat States may disqualify persons holding or attempting\nto hold state office. But States have no power under the\nConstitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal of-\nfices, especially the Presidency.\n    \u201cIn our federal system, the National Government pos-\nsesses only limited powers; the States and the people retain\nthe remainder.\u201d Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. 844, 854\n(2014). Among those retained powers is the power of a\nState to \u201corder the processes of its own governance.\u201d Alden\nv. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 752 (1999). In particular, the\nStates enjoy sovereign \u201cpower to prescribe the qualifica-\ntions of their own officers\u201d and \u201cthe manner of their election\n. . . free from external interference, except so far as plainly\nprovided by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Taylor\nv. Beckham, 178 U. S. 548, 570\u2013571 (1900). Although the\nFourteenth Amendment restricts state power, nothing in it\nplainly withdraws from the States this traditional author-\nity. And after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nStates used this authority to disqualify state officers in ac-\ncordance with state statutes. See, e.g., Worthy v. Barrett,\n63 N. C. 199, 200, 204 (1869) (elected county sheriff ); State\nex rel. Sandlin v. Watkins, 21 La. Ann. 631, 631\u2013633 (1869)\n(state judge).\n    Such power over governance, however, does not extend to\nfederal officeholders and candidates. Because federal offic-\ners \u201c \u2018owe their existence and functions to the united voice\nof the whole, not of a portion, of the people,\u2019 \u201d powers over\ntheir election and qualifications must be specifically \u201cdele-\ngated to, rather than reserved by, the States.\u201d U. S. Term\n\f                 Cite as: 601 U. S. ____ (2024)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nLimits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 803\u2013804 (1995)\n(quoting 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of\nthe United States \u00a7627, p. 435 (3d ed. 1858)). But nothing\nin the Constitution delegates to the States any power to en-\nforce Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates.\n   As an initial matter, not even the respondents contend\nthat the Constitution authorizes States to somehow remove\nsitting federal officeholders who may be violating Section 3.\nSuch a power would flout the principle that \u201cthe Constitu-\ntion guarantees \u2018the entire independence of the General\nGovernment from any control by the respective States.\u2019 \u201d\nTrump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 800 (2020) (quoting Farmers\nand Mechanics Sav. Bank of Minneapolis v. Minnesota, 232\nU. S. 516, 521 (1914)). Indeed, consistent with that princi-\nple, States lack even the lesser powers to issue writs of\nmandamus against federal officials or to grant habeas cor-\npus relief to persons in federal custody. See McClung v.\nSilliman, 6 Wheat. 598, 603\u2013605 (1821); Tarble\u2019s Case, 13\nWall. 397, 405\u2013410 (1872).\n   The respondents nonetheless maintain that States may\nenforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. But\nthe text of the Fourteenth Amendment, on its face, does not\naffirmatively delegate such a power to the States. The\nterms of the Amendment speak only to enforcement by Con-\ngress, which enjoys power to enforce the Amendment\nthrough legislation pursuant to Section 5.\n   This can hardly come as a surprise, given that the sub-\nstantive provisions of the Amendment \u201cembody significant\nlimitations on state authority.\u201d Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427\nU. S. 445, 456 (1976). Under the Amendment, States can-\nnot abridge privileges or immunities, deprive persons of\nlife, liberty, or property without due process, deny equal\nprotection, or deny male inhabitants the right to vote (with-\nout thereby suffering reduced representation in the House).\nSee Amdt. 14, \u00a7\u00a71, 2. On the other hand, the Fourteenth\nAmendment grants new power to Congress to enforce the\n\f8                        TRUMP v. ANDERSON\n\n                                Per Curiam\n\nprovisions of the Amendment against the States. It would\nbe incongruous to read this particular Amendment as\ngranting the States the power\u2014silently no less\u2014to disqual-\nify a candidate for federal office.\n   The only other plausible constitutional sources of such a\ndelegation are the Elections and Electors Clauses, which\nauthorize States to conduct and regulate congressional and\nPresidential elections, respectively. See Art. I, \u00a74, cl. 1;\nArt. II, \u00a71, cl. 2.1 But there is little reason to think that\nthese Clauses implicitly authorize the States to enforce Sec-\ntion 3 against federal officeholders and candidates. Grant-\ning the States that authority would invert the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s rebalancing of federal and state power.\n   The text of Section 3 reinforces these conclusions. Its fi-\nnal sentence empowers Congress to \u201cremove\u201d any Section 3\n\u201cdisability\u201d by a two-thirds vote of each house. The text im-\nposes no limits on that power, and Congress may exercise it\nany time, as the respondents concede. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 50. In fact, historically, Congress sometimes ex-\nercised this amnesty power postelection to ensure that\nsome of the people\u2019s chosen candidates could take office.2\nBut if States were free to enforce Section 3 by barring can-\ndidates from running in the first place, Congress would be\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Elections Clause directs, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he Times,\n\nPlaces and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representa-\ntives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\u201d Art.\nI, \u00a74, cl. 1. The Electors Clause similarly provides that \u201c[e]ach State\nshall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a\nNumber of Electors,\u201d who in turn elect the President. Art. II, \u00a71, cl. 2.\n   2 Shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, for instance,\n\nCongress enacted a private bill to remove the Section 3 disability of Nel-\nson Tift of Georgia, who had recently been elected to represent the State\nin Congress. See ch. 393, 15 Stat. 427. Tift took his seat in Congress\nimmediately thereafter. See Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 4499\u2013\n4500 (1868). Congress similarly acted postelection to remove the disa-\nbilities of persons elected to state and local offices. See Cong. Globe, 40th\nCong., 3d Sess., 29\u201330, 120\u2013121 (1868); ch. 5, 15 Stat. 435\u2013436.\n\f                    Cite as: 601 U.

Perhaps a State may burden con-\ngressional authority in such a way when it exercises its \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d sovereign power over its own state offices. Taylor,\n178 U. S., at 571. But it is implausible to suppose that the\nConstitution affirmatively delegated to the States the au-\nthority to impose such a burden on congressional power\nwith respect to candidates for federal office. Cf. McCulloch\nv. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436 (1819) (\u201cStates have no\npower . . . to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner con-\ntrol, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by\nCongress\u201d).\n  Nor have the respondents identified any tradition of state\nenforcement of Section 3 against federal officeholders or\ncandidates in the years following ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment.3 Such a lack of historical precedent is\ngenerally a \u201c \u2018telling indication\u2019 \u201d of a \u201c \u2018severe constitutional\nproblem\u2019 \u201d with the asserted power. United States v. Texas,\n599 U. S. 670, 677 (2023) (quoting Free Enterprise Fund v.\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477,\n505 (2010)). And it is an especially telling sign here, be-\ncause as noted, States did disqualify persons from holding\nstate offices following ratification of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. That pattern of disqualification with respect to state,\nbut not federal offices provides \u201cpersuasive evidence of a\ngeneral understanding\u201d that the States lacked enforcement\npower with respect to the latter. U. S. Term Limits, 514\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 We are aware of just one example of state enforcement against a\n\nwould-be federal officer. In 1868, the Governor of Georgia refused to\ncommission John Christy, who had won the most votes in a congressional\nelection, because\u2014in the Governor\u2019s view\u2014Section 3 made Christy inel-\nigible to serve. But the Governor\u2019s determination was not final; a com-\nmittee of the House reviewed Christy\u2019s qualifications itself and recom-\nmended that he not be seated. The full House never acted on the matter,\nand Christy was never seated. See 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House\nof Representatives \u00a7459, pp. 470\u2013472 (1907).\n\f10                  TRUMP v. ANDERSON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nU. S., at 826.\n   Instead, it is Congress that has long given effect to Sec-\ntion 3 with respect to would-be or existing federal office-\nholders. Shortly after ratification of the Amendment, Con-\ngress enacted the Enforcement Act of 1870. That Act\nauthorized federal district attorneys to bring civil actions in\nfederal court to remove anyone holding nonlegislative of-\nfice\u2014federal or state\u2014in violation of Section 3, and made\nholding or attempting to hold office in violation of Section 3\na federal crime. \u00a7\u00a714, 15, 16 Stat. 143\u2013144 (repealed, 35\nStat. 1153\u20131154, 62 Stat. 992\u2013993). In the years following\nratification, the House and Senate exercised their unique\npowers under Article I to adjudicate challenges contending\nthat certain prospective or sitting Members could not take\nor retain their seats due to Section 3. See Art. I, \u00a75, cls. 1,\n2; 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives\n\u00a7\u00a7459\u2013463, pp. 470\u2013486 (1907). And the Confiscation Act\nof 1862, which predated Section 3, effectively provided an\nadditional procedure for enforcing disqualification. That\nlaw made engaging in insurrection or rebellion, among\nother acts, a federal crime punishable by disqualification\nfrom holding office under the United States. See \u00a7\u00a72, 3, 12\nStat. 590. A successor to those provisions remains on the\nbooks today. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a72383.\n   Moreover, permitting state enforcement of Section 3\nagainst federal officeholders and candidates would raise se-\nrious questions about the scope of that power. Section 5\nlimits congressional legislation enforcing Section 3, because\nSection 5 is strictly \u201cremedial.\u201d City of Boerne, 521 U. S., at\n520.

S., at\n520. Neither we nor the respondents are aware of any other\nlegislation by Congress to enforce Section 3. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 123.\n    Any state enforcement of Section 3 against federal office-\nholders and candidates, though, would not derive from Sec-\ntion 5, which confers power only on \u201c[t]he Congress.\u201d As a\nresult, such state enforcement might be argued to sweep\nmore broadly than congressional enforcement could under\nour precedents. But the notion that the Constitution grants\nthe States freer rein than Congress to decide how Section 3\nshould be enforced with respect to federal offices is simply\nimplausible.\n    Finally, state enforcement of Section 3 with respect to the\nPresidency would raise heightened concerns. \u201c[I]n the con-\ntext of a Presidential election, state-imposed restrictions\nimplicate a uniquely important national interest.\u201d Ander-\nson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 794\u2013795 (1983) (footnote\nomitted). But state-by-state resolution of the question\nwhether Section 3 bars a particular candidate for President\nfrom serving would be quite unlikely to yield a uniform an-\nswer consistent with the basic principle that \u201cthe President\n. . . represent[s] all the voters in the Nation.\u201d Id., at 795\n(emphasis added).\n    Conflicting state outcomes concerning the same candi-\ndate could result not just from differing views of the merits,\nbut from variations in state law governing the proceedings\nthat are necessary to make Section 3 disqualification deter-\nminations.

ANDERSON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nothers might require a heightened showing. Certain evi-\ndence (like the congressional Report on which the lower\ncourts relied here) might be admissible in some States but\ninadmissible hearsay in others. Disqualification might be\npossible only through criminal prosecution, as opposed to\nexpedited civil proceedings, in particular States. Indeed, in\nsome States\u2014unlike Colorado (or Maine, where the secre-\ntary of state recently issued an order excluding former Pres-\nident Trump from the primary ballot)\u2014procedures for ex-\ncluding an ineligible candidate from the ballot may not\nexist at all. The result could well be that a single candidate\nwould be declared ineligible in some States, but not others,\nbased on the same conduct (and perhaps even the same fac-\ntual record).\n   The \u201cpatchwork\u201d that would likely result from state en-\nforcement would \u201csever the direct link that the Framers\nfound so critical between the National Government and the\npeople of the United States\u201d as a whole.

This suit was\nbrought by Colorado voters under state law in state court.\nIt does not require us to address the complicated question\nwhether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through\nwhich Section 3 can be enforced.\n   The majority\u2019s choice of a different path leaves the re-\nmaining Justices with a choice of how to respond. In my\njudgment, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with\nstridency. The Court has settled a politically charged issue\nin the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particu-\nlarly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should\nturn the national temperature down, not up.

Jackson\nWomen\u2019s Health Organization, 597 U. S. 215, 348 (2022)\n(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). That fundamen-\ntal principle of judicial restraint is practically as old as our\nRepublic. This Court is authorized \u201cto say what the law is\u201d\nonly because \u201c[t]hose who apply [a] rule to particular cases\n. . . must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.\u201d\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis\nadded).\n    Today, the Court departs from that vital principle, decid-\ning not just this case, but challenges that might arise in the\nfuture. In this case, the Court must decide whether Colo-\nrado may keep a Presidential candidate off the ballot on the\nground that he is an oathbreaking insurrectionist and thus\ndisqualified from holding federal office under Section 3 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Allowing Colorado to do so\nwould, we agree, create a chaotic state-by-state patchwork,\nat odds with our Nation\u2019s federalism principles. That is\nenough to resolve this case. Yet the majority goes further.\nEven though \u201c[a]ll nine Members of the Court\u201d agree that\nthis independent and sufficient rationale resolves this case,\n\f2                    TRUMP v.

They decide novel constitutional ques-\ntions to insulate this Court and petitioner from future con-\ntroversy. Ante, at 13. Although only an individual State\u2019s\naction is at issue here, the majority opines on which federal\nactors can enforce Section 3, and how they must do so. The\nmajority announces that a disqualification for insurrection\ncan occur only when Congress enacts a particular kind of\nlegislation pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. In doing so, the majority shuts the door on other po-\ntential means of federal enforcement. We cannot join an\nopinion that decides momentous and difficult issues unnec-\nessarily, and we therefore concur only in the judgment.\n                              I\n   Our Constitution leaves some questions to the States\nwhile committing others to the Federal Government. Fed-\neralism principles embedded in that constitutional struc-\nture decide this case. States cannot use their control over\nthe ballot to \u201cundermine the National Government.\u201d U. S.\nTerm Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 810 (1995).\nThat danger is even greater \u201cin the context of a Presidential\nelection.\u201d Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 794\u2013795\n(1983). State restrictions in that context \u201cimplicate a\nuniquely important national interest\u201d extending beyond a\nState\u2019s \u201cown borders.\u201d Ibid. No doubt, States have signifi-\ncant \u201cauthority over presidential electors\u201d and, in turn,\nPresidential elections. Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U. S.\n578, 588 (2020). That power, however, is limited by \u201cother\nconstitutional constraint[s],\u201d including federalism princi-\nples. Id., at 589.\n   The majority rests on such principles when it explains\nwhy Colorado cannot take Petitioner off the ballot. \u201c[S]tate-\nby-state resolution of the question whether Section 3 bars a\nparticular candidate for President from serving,\u201d the major-\nity explains, \u201cwould be quite unlikely to yield a uniform an-\nswer consistent with the basic principle that \u2018the President\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U.

S., at 795). That is especially so,\nthe majority adds, because different States can reach \u201c[c]on-\nflicting . . . outcomes concerning the same candidate . . . not\njust from differing views of the merits, but from variations\nin state law governing the proceedings\u201d to enforce Section\n3. Ante, at 11.\n    The contrary conclusion that a handful of officials in a\nfew States could decide the Nation\u2019s next President would\nbe especially surprising with respect to Section 3. The Re-\nconstruction Amendments \u201cwere specifically designed as an\nexpansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sover-\neignty.\u201d City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 179\n(1980). Section 3 marked the first time the Constitution\nplaced substantive limits on a State\u2019s authority to choose\nits own officials. Given that context, it would defy logic for\nSection 3 to give States new powers to determine who may\nhold the Presidency. Cf. ante, at 8 (\u201cIt would be incongru-\nous to read this particular Amendment as granting the\nStates the power\u2014silently no less\u2014to disqualify a candi-\ndate for federal office\u201d).\n    That provides a secure and sufficient basis to resolve this\ncase. To allow Colorado to take a presidential candidate off\nthe ballot under Section 3 would imperil the Framers\u2019 vi-\nsion of \u201ca Federal Government directly responsible to the\npeople.\u201d U. S. Term Limits, 514 U. S., at 821. The Court\nshould have started and ended its opinion with this conclu-\nsion.\n                              II\n   Yet the Court continues on to resolve questions not before\nus. In a case involving no federal action whatsoever, the\nCourt opines on how federal enforcement of Section 3 must\nproceed. Congress, the majority says, must enact legisla-\ntion under Section 5 prescribing the procedures to \u201c \u2018 \u201cascer-\ntain[ ] what particular individuals\u201d \u2019 \u201d should be disqualified.\n\f4                    TRUMP v. ANDERSON\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, KAGAN, and JACKSON, JJ., concurring in judgment\n\nAnte, at 5 (quoting Griffin\u2019s Case, 11 F. Cas. 7, 26\n(No. 5,815) (CC Va. 1869) (Chase, Circuit Justice)). These\nmusings are as inadequately supported as they are gratui-\ntous.\n   To start, nothing in Section 3\u2019s text supports the major-\nity\u2019s view of how federal disqualification efforts must oper-\nate. Section 3 states simply that \u201c[n]o person shall\u201d hold\ncertain positions and offices if they are oathbreaking insur-\nrectionists. Amdt. 14. Nothing in that unequivocal bar sug-\ngests that implementing legislation enacted under Section\n5 is \u201ccritical\u201d (or, for that matter, what that word means in\nthis context). Ante, at 5. In fact, the text cuts the opposite\nway. Section 3 provides that when an oathbreaking insur-\nrectionist is disqualified, \u201cCongress may by a vote of two-\nthirds of each House, remove such disability.\u201d It is hard to\nunderstand why the Constitution would require a congres-\nsional supermajority to remove a disqualification if a simple\nmajority could nullify Section 3\u2019s operation by repealing or\ndeclining to pass implementing legislation. Even peti-\ntioner\u2019s lawyer acknowledged the \u201ctension\u201d in Section 3 that\nthe majority\u2019s view creates. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\n   Similarly, nothing else in the rest of the Fourteenth\nAmendment supports the majority\u2019s view. Section 5 gives\nCongress the \u201cpower to enforce [the Amendment] by appro-\npriate legislation.\u201d Remedial legislation of any kind, how-\never, is not required. All the Reconstruction Amendments\n(including the due process and equal protection guarantees\nand prohibition of slavery) \u201care self-executing,\u201d meaning\nthat they do not depend on legislation. City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U. S. 507, 524 (1997); see Civil Rights Cases, 109\nU. S. 3, 20 (1883). Similarly, other constitutional rules of\ndisqualification, like the two-term limit on the Presidency,\ndo not require implementing legislation. See, e.g., Art. II,\n\u00a71, cl. 5 (Presidential Qualifications); Amdt. 22 (Presiden-\ntial Term Limits). Nor does the majority suggest otherwise.\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U. S. ____ (2024)                5\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, KAGAN, and JACKSON, JJ., concurring in judgment\n\nIt simply creates a special rule for the insurrection disabil-\nity in Section 3.\n   The majority is left with next to no support for its require-\nment that a Section 3 disqualification can occur only pursu-\nant to legislation enacted for that purpose. It cites Griffin\u2019s\nCase, but that is a nonprecedential, lower court opinion by\na single Justice in his capacity as a circuit judge. See ante,\nat 5 (quoting 11 F. Cas., at 26). Once again, even peti-\ntioner\u2019s lawyer distanced himself from fully embracing this\ncase as probative of Section 3\u2019s meaning. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 35\u201336. The majority also cites Senator Trumbull\u2019s\nstatements that Section 3 \u201c \u2018provide[d] no means for enforc-\ning\u2019 \u201d itself. Ante, at 5 (quoting Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st\nSess., 626 (1869)). The majority, however, neglects to men-\ntion the Senator\u2019s view that \u201c[i]t is the [F]ourteenth\n[A]mendment that prevents a person from holding office,\u201d\nwith the proposed legislation simply \u201caffor[ding] a more ef-\nficient and speedy remedy\u201d for effecting the disqualifica-\ntion. Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st Sess., at 626\u2013627.\n   Ultimately, under the guise of providing a more \u201ccom-\nplete explanation for the judgment,\u201d ante, at 13, the major-\nity resolves many unsettled questions about Section 3. It\nforecloses judicial enforcement of that provision, such as\nmight occur when a party is prosecuted by an insurrection-\nist and raises a defense on that score. The majority further\nholds that any legislation to enforce this provision must\nprescribe certain procedures \u201c \u2018tailor[ed]\u2019 \u201d to Section 3, ante,\nat 10, ruling out enforcement under general federal stat-\nutes requiring the government to comply with the law. By\nresolving these and other questions, the majority attempts\nto insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future chal-\nlenges to their holding federal office.\n                       *    *     *\n  \u201cWhat it does today, the Court should have left undone.\u201d\n\f6                    TRUMP v. ANDERSON\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, KAGAN, and JACKSON, JJ., concurring in judgment\n\nBush v. Gore, 531 U. S. 98, 158 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissent-\ning). The Court today needed to resolve only a single ques-\ntion: whether an individual State may keep a Presidential\ncandidate found to have engaged in insurrection off its bal-\nlot. The majority resolves much more than the case before\nus. Although federal enforcement of Section 3 is in no way\nat issue, the majority announces novel rules for how that\nenforcement must operate. It reaches out to decide Section\n3 questions not before us, and to foreclose future efforts to\ndisqualify a Presidential candidate under that provision. In\na sensitive case crying out for judicial restraint, it abandons\nthat course.\n   Section 3 serves an important, though rarely needed, role\nin our democracy. The American people have the power to\nvote for and elect candidates for national office, and that is\na great and glorious thing. The men who drafted and rati-\nfied the Fourteenth Amendment, however, had witnessed\nan \u201cinsurrection [and] rebellion\u201d to defend slavery. \u00a73.\nThey wanted to ensure that those who had participated in\nthat insurrection, and in possible future insurrections,\ncould not return to prominent roles. Today, the majority\ngoes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section\n3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming\nPresident. Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce\nSection 3, we protest the majority\u2019s effort to use this case to\ndefine the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.\nBecause we would decide only the issue before us, we concur\nonly in the judgment.\n\f", "download_url": "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-719_19m2.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2024/03/04/trump_v._anderson_1.pdf", "date_created": "2024-03-15T08:02:22.704736-07:00", "date_modified": "2024-03-15T08:42:39.421057-07:00", "opinions_cited": [], "keypoints": [{"text": "The Colorado Supreme Court agreed with the contention that former President Donald J.
